<p class="pc4 xlarge"><b>The Border Boys with the<br />
Mexican Rangers.</b></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">AN IMPRUDENT BEAR.</span></p>

<p>Professor Wintergreen sat bolt upright amidst
his blankets and listened intently. Had it been
daylight, the angular figure of the scientist would
have made a laughable spectacle. But the canyon
in the State of Sonora, in Western Mexico, in
which the Border Boys and their preceptor were
camped, was pitchy dark with a velvety blackness,
relieved only by a few steely-looking stars
shining from the open spaces of a fast overclouding
sky.</p>

<p>The night wind soughed in melancholy fashion
through the trees that clothed the sides of
the rugged abyss in which the camp had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
pitched that evening, and the tinkle of the tiny
stream that threaded its depths was audible. But
although these were the only sounds to be heard
at the moment, it was neither of them that had
startled the professor. No, what he had heard
had been something far different.</p>

<p>Waking some hours after he had first fallen
asleep, the man of science had indulged his sleepless
moments by plunging into mental calculations
of an abstruse character. He was deeply
engrossed in these, when the sudden sound had
broken in on the quietness of the night.</p>

<p>“Bless me, I could have sworn that I heard a
footstep, and a stealthy one, too,” muttered the
professor to himself, “I must be getting nervous.
Possibly that is what made me wake up, and&mdash;wow!”</p>

<p>The ruminations of Professor Wintergreen
broke off abruptly as he suddenly felt something
warm and hairy brush his face.</p>

<p>“It’s a bear!” he yelled, springing to his feet
with a shout that instantly aroused the others,&mdash;Jack Merrill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the rancher’s son; Ralph Stetson,
his schoolmate from old Stonefell; Coyote Pete,
and Walt Phelps.</p>

<p>“A b’ar!” yelled Coyote Pete, awake in a
flash, “wha’r is ther varmint?” As he spoke,
the plainsman drew forth his well-worn old
forty-four and began flourishing it about.</p>

<p>Before the others could say a word a dark
form bolted suddenly through the camp, scattering,
as it went, the embers of the dying campfire.</p>

<p>“It’s a bear, sure enough!” exclaimed Ralph,
as the creature, a small bear of the black variety,
howled and stumbled amidst the hot coals.</p>

<p>All at once its shaggy coat burst into flame,
and with a cry of intense agony it dashed off into
the woods.</p>

<p>“Poor creature!” cried Jack Merrill, “it will
die in misery unless it’s put out of its agony
quickly. Pete, lend me your gun.”</p>

<p>The plainsman handed it over with a quick
interrogation to which he received no reply. Instead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Jack made a swift dash for the spot, a
few feet distant, in which the horses of the
party were tethered. Throwing himself on the
back of one, with a twisted halter for a bridle, he
set off in hot pursuit of the unfortunate bear.</p>

<p>He could see it quite plainly as it lumbered
along through the woods, crying pitifully. Its
long coat, greasy and shaggy, burned like a
torch.</p>

<p>“Get along, Firewater, old boy,” breathed Jack,
bending over his animal’s neck to avoid being
brushed off by the low-hanging branches, for,
after a short distance, the tangle on the hillside
at the canyon’s bottom grew thick and dense.</p>

<p>But Firewater, alarmed and startled at the
spectacle of the flaming beast rushing along
through the dark woods in front, balked and
jumped about and misbehaved in a manner very
foreign to him when he had his young master
on his back.</p>

<p>But Jack never made the mistake of allowing
a pony or horse to think it could get the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
hand of him, and, consequently, Firewater soon
quieted down and realized that there was no help
for it but to go whither he was directed.</p>

<p>At length Jack arrived within pistol shot of
the frenzied bear. Aiming as carefully as he
could for a death shot, he pressed the trigger and
the wretched animal,&mdash;the victim of its own curiosity,&mdash;plunged
over and lay still.</p>

<p>“Poor creature,” quoth Jack to himself, “you
are not the first to pay the toll of too much inquisitiveness.
Gee whiz!” he broke off the next
instant with one of his hearty, wholesome laughs,
“I’m getting to be as much of a moralist as the
professor.”</p>

<p>Having ascertained that the bear was quite
dead and out of its suffering, the Border Boy
remounted his pony and pressed back toward
camp. But as he neared it, it was borne in upon
him that the adventures of the night were by no
means at an end, for before he reached the others,
and while a thick screen of brush still lay between
him and the glow of the newly made camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fire, a sudden volley of shots and the clattering
of many horses’ hoofs broke the stillness.</p>

<p>A touch of the heel was enough to send Firewater
bounding forward. The next instant the
brush had been cleared, and a strange spectacle
met Jack Merrill’s eyes. His companions, their
weapons in hand, stood about the fire staring here
and there into the darkness. A puzzled expression
was on all their faces, and particularly was
this true of the professor, who was scrutinizing,
through his immense horn spectacles, a scrap of
paper which he held in his hand. He was stooping
low by the firelight the better to examine it.</p>

<p>“Oh, here you are,” cried Ralph, as the returned
young adventurer came forward into the
glow.</p>

<p>“Yes, here I am,” cried Jack, throwing himself
from Firewater’s back. “I despatched that bear,
too, but what on earth has been happening here?”</p>

<p>“Read this first, my boy, and then I will tell
you,” said the professor, thrusting the not over-clean
bit of paper into his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Read it aloud,” urged Pete, and Jack, in a
clear voice, read the untidy scrawl as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1 reduct">“Señors; you are on a mission perilous. Advance
no further but turn back while you are
safe. The Mountains of Chinipal are not for
your seeking, and what you shall find there if
you persevere in your quest will prove more
deadly than the Upas tree. Be warned in time.
Adios.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Phew!” whistled Jack, “that sounds nice. But
what was all the firing&mdash;for I suppose that had
something to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Why, the firing was my work,” struck in Walt
Phelps, looking rather shamefaced, “and I’m
afraid I wounded the man I shot at, too.”</p>

<p>“You see it was this way,” went on Ralph
Stetson. “We were watching the woods for your
coming when, suddenly, a horseman appeared,
as if by magic, from off there.”</p>

<p>He pointed behind him into the dark and silent
trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Under the impression that we were attacked,
I guess, Walt opened fire. But the man did not
return it. Instead, he flung that note, which
was tied to a bit of stone, at our feet, and then
dashed off as suddenly as he had come. What
do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think,” rejoined Jack in
a puzzled tone; “suppose we ask the professor
and Pete first.”</p>

<p>“A good idea,” chorused the other boys.
“Well, boys,” said the professor anxiously, “not
being as well versed in such things as our friend
Mr. Coyote, I shall defer to him. One thing, however,
I noticed, and that was that the note is
worded in fair English, although badly written
in an uneducated hand.”</p>

<p>“Maybe whoever wrote it wished to disguise
his writing,” ventured Walt Phelps.</p>

<p>“That’s my idee of it,” grunted Coyote Pete;
“yer see,” he went on, “ther thing looks this yer
way ter me. Some chap who knows of a plot on
foot ter keep us frum the Chinipal, wanted to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
us a good turn, but didn’t dare be seen in our
company. So he hits on this way of doing it
and gits drilled with a bullet fer his pains.”</p>

<p>Walt Phelps colored brilliantly. He felt
ashamed of his haste.</p>

<p>“Don’t be upsot over it,” said Pete, noticing
this, “it’s ther chap’s own fault fer dashing in
on us that way. I reckon, though, he kalkerlated
on finding us asleep, an’ so we would have bin if
it hadn’t a bin fer Mister flaming b’ar.”</p>

<p>“The question is, are we to heed this warning,
or is it, what I believe is sometimes termed a
bluff?” asked the professor anxiously. He drew
his blankets about his skinny figure as he spoke,
and stood in the firelight looking like a spectacled
and emaciated ancient statue.</p>

<p>Coyote Pete considered a minute.</p>

<p>“Suppose we leave that till the morning fer
discussion,” he said. “In my judgment, it will be
best fer you folks ter turn in now and sleep ther
rest of ther night.”</p>

<p>“And you, Pete?” asked Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll watch by the fire in case of another visit.
I don’t think there’ll be one, but you cain’t most
gen’ally always tell. Gimme my gun back, Jack;
I might need it.”</p>

<p>There was no dissuading Coyote from his plan,
so the others turned in once more, and, despite
the startling interruption to their slumbers, were
soon wrapped in sleep.</p>

<p>As for Coyote, he sat by the fire till the stars
began to pale and the eastern sky grew gray and
wan with the dawn. Except for an occasional
swift glance about him the old plainsman’s eyes
were riveted on the glowing coals, seemingly
searching the innermost glowing caverns for
some solution of the situation that confronted
them.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">RUGGLES&mdash;THE DERELICT.</p>

<p>But you lads who are not already acquainted
with the adventurous Border Boys, must be wishing,
by this time, to know something about them
and of the quest which brought them into this
wild and rugged part of the great Mexican Republic.
In the first volume of this series “The
Border Boys on The Trail,” it was related how
Ralph Stetson, a somewhat delicate young easterner,&mdash;the
son of “King Pin” Stetson, the railroad
magnate,&mdash;came out west to visit his school
chum Jack Merrill, the only son of a ranch
owner.</p>

<p>The lads’ adventures in pursuit of a band of
cattle rustlers,&mdash;headed by Black Ramon de Barros,&mdash;were
related in full in that volume. There
also, it was told how they escaped from the mysterious
old mission and found a rich treasure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a secret passage of the mouldering structure.
Jack’s bravery in preventing Black Ramon from
destroying a dam and flooding the country was
also an incident of that book. But although the
boys had succeeded in routing Black Ramon for
the nonce, that scourge of the border was destined
to be re-encountered by them.</p>

<p>How this came about we told in the second volume
of this series, “The Border Boys Across The
Frontier.” Beginning with their discovery of
the subterranean river leading from the Haunted
Mesa across the border, the lads were plunged
into an amazing series of adventures. These culminated
in the attack on the Esmeralda,&mdash;a mine
owned by Jack’s father,&mdash;and the gallant defense
of it by our lads and their faithful friends. The
attacking force was composed of Mexican rebels
and they were only repulsed by an unexpected
happening. Black Ramon was active in this part
of the boys’ adventures, too. For a time it looked
as if they at last had brought the rascal with the
coal black horse to book. But it proved otherwise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and Black Ramon once more made good
his escape from the arm of the law.</p>

<p>Their adventures in Mexico over, and the revolution
brought to a termination by the abdication
of President Diaz, the Border Boys settled down
to spend the rest of their vacation in comparative
monotony. A few weeks before the present story
opens, however, an incident had occurred which
seemed destined once more to provide some excitement
for them.</p>

<p>Mr. Stetson, whose railroad interests had
brought him to Mexico during the fighting days,
had paid a hasty visit to the ranch and spent some
time in consultation with Mr. Merrill. Professor
Wintergreen had also been summoned to the conference.
It appeared that the railroad king had,
some years before, materially aided a young college
friend who had fallen on hard times. The
beneficiary of his aid had, however, ultimately
wandered away from the position with which
Mr. Stetson had provided him, without leaving a
word or a sign of his destination. The years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
rolled by and Mr. Stetson had practically forgotten
all about the man, when, during his stay
in El Paso, a wretched, ragged figure had confronted
him on the street one day and disclosed
his identity as Stewart Ruggles, the outcast.</p>

<p>Mr. Stetson, shocked at his old friend’s abject
appearance of misery and illness, ordered a carriage
and took him to his hotel. Here, after Ruggles
had been suitably clothed and fed, Mr. Stetson
listened to his story. After wandering off so
many years before, Ruggles, it seems, had fallen
in with bad company. He finally had become
connected with a bank robbery and had been
compelled to seek refuge in Mexico. After knocking
about for many lonely years, he became a
prospector.</p>

<p>One spring had found him in the mountains
of Chinipal, with his burros and prospecting outfit.
He met with indifferent luck and was about
to vacate the country, when, one day, in a rugged
pass, he heard groans coming from the trailside.
Investigating, he found a Yaqui, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
swept from his horse by an overhanging branch,
and whose leg was broken. With characteristic
brutality and callousness, the rest of the tribe had
passed on, leaving the wounded man to shift as
best he might.</p>

<p>Ruggles, who had some rough knowledge of
surgery, set the man’s leg and tended him for several
days. At last one day the Yaqui was ready
to ride on. But before he left he confided to
Ruggles the location of a mountain known to the
Indians as the Trembling Mountain. In a cavern
in the interior of this eminence,&mdash;so the Indian
legend had it,&mdash;a vanished race of aborigines
had hidden vast treasures of gold and sacrificial
emblems of great value. Asked why, if this was
the case, his own tribesmen had not sought for
it, the Yaqui had declared that rather than enter
the mountain his fellows would cut off their right
hands. It was, according to their belief, guarded
by the spirits of the dead and gone race, and
terrible vengeance would light on the head of the
luckless mortal who offended them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the Indian’s direction Ruggles had
drawn up a rough map of the location of
Trembling Mountain and then, determined to
investigate it, had set out for the north to find
proper equipment for his quest. But he found
the land in the throes of revolution, and where
he was not laughed at as a lunatic he was told to
wait till times became more settled. In poverty
and despair he was wandering the streets of El
Paso when chance threw him across the path of
his old college mate.</p>

<p>Mr. Stetson, who had been known as one of
the most daring operators on Wall Street, believed
where others had scoffed. He agreed to
back Ruggles in his quest to any amount. But
while active preparations were still on foot, a
fever seized the prospector. His impoverished
frame was unable to resist the attack, and in a
few days he breathed his last, not before,
however, he had confided to Mr. Stetson his wish
that the latter would carry out the quest.</p>

<p>The railroad king faithfully saw the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of his unfortunate and erring friend to the grave,
and then began to consider the feasibility of the
enterprise to which he stood committed. It was
clear, he decided, that the mission was no ordinary
one. It could only be performed by trustworthy
agents, for, in the event of the treasure
being there, the temptation to play him false
would be tremendous. Then, too, it must be kept
secret, because, on the face of it, the venture
appeared such a far-fetched and desperate one
that unless success crowned it its promoter was
likely to be heaped with ridicule from one end of
the country to the other.</p>

<p>Altogether, Mr. Stetson was at a standstill till
he suddenly bethought himself of the Border
Boys and their companions, Coyote Pete and
Professor Wintergreen.</p>

<p>With his customary promptitude, he had lost
no time in getting to the Merrill ranch. At first
the rancher was unwilling that his son should
embark on such an enterprise, but on Jack’s
pleadings to be allowed to participate, he finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
agreed on the condition, however, that no unnecessary
risks were to be run.</p>

<p>The fact that Coyote Pete and Professor Wintergreen
were to go along played no small part
in enabling the rancher to make up his mind.
As for Mr. Stetson, he remarked:</p>

<p>“Ralph will have to play his part in the world
before very long now, and such adventures are
good for him. They form character and make
him quick in action and decision.”</p>

<p>And so it came about, that a week before, our
party had disembarked from, the queer little narrow-gauge
train at Esmedora, on the borders
of Sonora,&mdash;the starting point of their three hundred
and fifty mile trip into the unknown. Not
unnaturally, some excitement had been created
at Esmedora by the arrival of so many strangers.
It had been given out by Professor Wintergreen
that the expedition was a scientific one and their
real destination was, of course, carefully concealed.
Firewater,&mdash;Jack’s favorite pony,&mdash;had
been the only animal brought from the States by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the party, as it was understood that excellent animals
could be purchased in Esmedora. This
proved to be the case.</p>

<p>Coyote Pete was provided with an excellent
little buckskin, while Ralph and Walt Phelps each
secured a calico pony. The professor’s mount
was a tall, bony animal, almost as lanky as himself,
but one which Coyote Pete pronounced a
“stayer.” Its color was a sort of nondescript
yellow, and the man of science, when mounted
on it with all his traps and appendages, cut an
odd figure. Besides the horses and ponies, two
pack burros were purchased to carry the somewhat
extensive outfit of the party.</p>

<p>Naturally, in that sleepy part of the country,
such purchases and preparations caused quite a
stir. By that species of wireless telegraphy
which prevails in parts of the world unprovided
with other means for the transmission of news,
the information was, in fact, in the few days the
party remained in Esmedora, diffused over a considerable
part of the country round about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>In due course it reached the ears of a person
to whom it was of peculiar interest. This individual
was one whom we have met before, and
whose presence in the vicinity would have caused
the Border Boys considerable anxiety had they
known of it. Who this man was, and what effect
his presence was to have upon events in the
immediate future we shall see before very long.</p>

<p>And now, after this considerable, but necessary
digression, it is high time we were getting back
to the camp in the canyon where we left the lads
and the professor enjoying peaceful repose, and
Coyote Pete hard at work thinking. Before the
morning was far advanced, however, the plainsman
aroused his comrades and a great scene of
bustle was soon going on.</p>

<p>While the professor visited the creek to indulge
in a good wash in its clear, cool waters, Walt
Phelps, who had already performed his ablutions,
cleaned up the “spider” with sand, and having
scoured it thoroughly he set about getting breakfast.
Coyote Pete attended to the horses and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
two burros, and Ralph Stetson, always fastidious,
“duded up,” as Jack called it, before a small
pocket mirror he had affixed to a tree.</p>

<p>As for Jack, while all this was doing, he set
off for a stroll.</p>

<p>“Too many cooks spoil the broth,” he remarked
laughingly, as he started. With him he carried
a light rifle thinking that he might encounter an
opportunity to bring down something acceptable
in the way of a rabbit or other “small deer,” for
breakfast.</p>

<p>His path took him by the spot on which the
night before he had killed the bear. The animal,
charred and blackened to a crisp, still lay there.
As he neared the place, however, a heavy flapping
of wings as several hideous “turkey buzzards”
arose heavily, apprised him that the carrion
birds had already gathered to the feast.
The lad noted that, before rising, the glutted
creatures had to run several yards with outspread
wings before they could gain an upward impetus.</p>

<p>The crisp beauty of the morning, the smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
greenery of the trees, and the thousand odors
and sounds about him all combined to make Jack
wander rather further than he had intended.
Then, too, a boy with a rifle always does go a
longer distance than he means to. That’s boy
nature.</p>

<p>All at once he found himself emerging from
the brush at a point rather higher up the canyon
side than their camp in the abyss. So gentle
had been the rise, however, that he had not
noticed it. Before him lay a sort of roughly
piled rampart of rocks. The boy was advancing
toward these to peer over their summits into the
valley below, when something suddenly arrested
his footsteps as abruptly as if a precipice had
yawned before him.</p>

<p>The sharp, acrid odor of tobacco had reached
his nostrils. At the same instant, too, he became
aware of the low hum of voices. The sounds
came from immediately in front of him, and seemingly
just below the rock rampart. With a beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
heart, and as silently as possible, the lad
crept forward to ascertain what other intruders
besides themselves had come into the primeval
fastnesses of the Sonora country.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">JACK’S ADVENTURE.</p>

<p>A few stealthy footsteps served to bring him
to the edge of the natural rampart, and then,
removing his sombrero, he peered over. What
he saw a few feet below him caused him to exercise
all his self-control to avoid uttering a sharp
exclamation. Around a smoldering fire, above
which hung an iron pot that emitted a savory
odor, lay several men. Swarthy Mexicans they
were, with villainous countenances for the most
part, although, to Jack’s astonishment, one of
the party had a fair Saxon skin and reddish hair,
which, with his blue eyes, made him seem oddly
out of place in the midst of the dark-skinned,
black-orbed group.</p>

<p>But Jack had little time to note these details,
for something else entirely occupied his attention.
This object was nothing less than one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the party who sat somewhat apart, trying the
edge of a hunting knife he had been sharpening
upon a bit of madrone wood. In the hawk-like
countenance and slender, active form, Jack Merrill
had not the least difficulty in recognizing
Black Ramon de Barros himself. At a short distance
from the swarthy rascal grazed his famous
coal-black horse. Even in his somewhat awkward
position Jack could not repress a thrill of
admiration as he gazed at the splendid proportions
and anatomy of the glossy-coated beast,
through whose delicate nostrils the light shone
redly.</p>

<p>“Lucky thing I’m down the wind from that
outfit,” thought the Border Boy. “I’ve heard it
said that Black Ramon’s horse can detect the
presence of a stranger as readily as a keen-scented
fox.”</p>

<p>Most of the Mexicans were rolling and smoking
slender cigarettes of powdered tobacco and
yellow corn paper. These had occasioned the
acrid smell which had luckily betrayed the existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the camp to Jack before a false step could
make them aware of his presence. Expelling a
cloud of blue smoke from his thin lips, Black
Ramon began speaking. He was addressing the
red-haired man who looked so oddly out of place
although he wore Mexican garb, red sash, flowing
trousers, short jacket and cone-crowned sombrero
with a mighty rim.</p>

<p>“You are sure that this Ruggles was not mistaken,
Senor Canfield?” he was saying.</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’d take my oath to that on a stack of Bibles,”
he said. “Ruggles was a pretty level-headed
chap although he led a fool’s life, and if he says
the In’jun told of a treasure in the Trembling
Mountain he was right.”</p>

<p>“What puzzles me, though, is that he should
have told you of it as well as this Americano
Stetson,&mdash;curses be upon him,”&mdash;grumbled Black
Ramon. “If he was, as you say, ‘on the level,’
why should he have betrayed his friend’s confidence?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you see,” responded the man addressed
as Canfield, slowly, “Ruggles and I had roughed
it together a bit, and I reckon he was a little off
his head with worry and the approach of the
fever when I met him in El Paso. Anyhow, he
spun out the whole yarn, with the exception of
the plan.”</p>

<p>“We can do without that,” said Black Ramon,
“I have often heard of the Trembling Mountain,
and can, I believe, find it without difficulty. But
you are sure that Senor Stetson has the plan?”</p>

<p>“I know it for a fact. That was the reason
that I hastened to dig you up as soon as I knew
he was fitting out an expedition to go after the
treasure. I thought you were the most likely
man in Mexico to carry out the job.”</p>

<p>“And you were not mistaken, Senor Canfield,”
rejoined the other with a gratified smile. “If the
treasure is there we will get it out, even if it
were only to obtain revenge on those Gringoes,
Jack Merrill and his chums. They drove me off
the border, they tricked me in Chihuahua, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
now the cards have changed, and I hold the
trumps. But you are certain we are far ahead of
them?”</p>

<p>“Positive,” was the rejoinder, “they are at
least two days’ march behind, and with our swift
animals we shall make the strike first, do not
fear.”</p>

<p>Jack was puzzled.</p>

<p>Clearly, from what he had heard, the Mexican
leader knew nothing of their doings, but that
they had started from Esmedora. On the other
hand, it appeared equally positive that Canfield
was the man who had carried the message into
their camp the night before and created so much
excitement. Jack noticed now, too, as a further
means of identification, that Canfield’s hand
was bandaged. Ramon seemed to notice this also
at the same instant.</p>

<p>“Your hand is hurt, senor,” he said sharply,
with a suspicious inflection.</p>

<p>“I cut it this morning while closing my knife,”
rejoined Canfield glibly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Ramson nodded and said nothing. In the
meantime one of the Mexicans had been busy
dishing out the contents of the pot and handing
portions about. The smell reminded Jack that
he was excessively hungry and concluding that
he had heard about all he wanted to, he prepared
to depart as silently as he had come. But as he
moved his legs an alarming thing happened. The
rock upon which he had been resting gave way
without the slightest warning. Jack made a desperate
effort to avoid crashing down with it, but
he was unsuccessful. With a roar and crash,
amid a flying cloud of dust, stones and twigs, the
rock and the Border Boy slid together into the
midst of the camp of the man whom Jack had
every reason on earth both to fear and detest.</p>

<p>But even as he was making his avalanche-like
slide down the steep bank. Jack’s active mind was
at work.</p>

<p>The instant his feet touched solid ground he
sprang upright with a terrific yell:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yee-ow-ow-ow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Todos Santos! It is El Diablo,” shrilled some
of the Mexicans. But Ramon, superstitious as
he was, was not to be thus easily alarmed.</p>

<p>“It’s a man!” he shouted, and then the next
instant:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Santa Maria! It’s one of the Border Boys!”</p>

<p>But so quickly had Jack moved that by the
time Ramon, the first to regain his wits, had recovered
from his surprise, the lad was already
among the Mexicans’ horses which were tethered
at some little distance. Jack’s quick eye had noted
that one of them was saddled and bridled. Like
a flash he was in the saddle, and plying the
quirt with might and main. Behind him came
a fusilade of shots, and he could feel the bullets
whistle as he crouched low on his stolen steed’s
neck. But he had assumed, and the event proved
correctly, that the Mexicans would not risk killing
one of their horses.</p>

<p>“Don’t hit the horse!” the fleeing boy heard
Ramon shout, as he dashed off. He really had
no idea in what direction he was going, but flogging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
his mount with unmerciful ferocity for the
kind-hearted Jack, the lad made all speed from
the vicinity of the Mexican camp.</p>

<p>“Hooray, I’ve shaken them off, anyhow,” he
thought to himself, as, after ten minutes or so
of hard riding he heard the shouts and cries
of the Mexicans grow faint behind him.</p>

<p>But in this assumption Jack had reckoned without
his host, in the shape of Black Ramon’s
famous sable steed.</p>

<p>As he drew rein he heard distinctly the sound
of a horse coming toward his halting place at a
terrific gait. No other horse than Black Ramon’s
could have kept up such a speed over such
ground, and Jack, with a sinking heart, realized
that if he did not act quickly he was likely to fall
into the outlaw’s hands once more.</p>

<p>The spot where he had halted was a small rocky
eminence surrounded by the luxuriant fern and
scrub growth which clothed the rugged floor of
the canyon.</p>

<p>To turn his panting animal and head off into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the dense growth was the work of an instant.
Hardly had he vanished, however, before the
fern parted once more and disclosed the form of
Ramon’s black horse with the outlaw himself
upon his glossy back.</p>

<p>Like Jack, Ramon halted as he reached the little
eminence, and listened intently. Despite the
speed he had made in pursuit, the black showed
hardly a trace of fatigue. His finely carved
nostrils dilated a little more than usual and his
large, intelligent eyes shone more brightly perhaps,
but that was all. He pricked his delicate
ears and seemed to be as keenly on the alert as
his master, whose face, just now, wore an expression
of almost diabolic rage and baffled fury.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Jack was loping along at as
fast a pace as he dared to go. The ground, as
has been said, was rough and stony to a degree,&mdash;the
worst sort of going for one who wished to
conceal the sound of his advance. But there was
no help for it; press on the boy must, or fall into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the hands of men whom he knew would give him
short shrift indeed.</p>

<p>“If ever this old plug stumbles&mdash;”</p>

<p>Such was the thought in Jack’s mind when the
exact event he had dreaded transpired.</p>

<p>His purloined animal gave a plunge forward
as its feet caught in a rock and a tangle of fern.</p>

<p>The next instant Jack was shot like a projectile
through space, while the horse, with an almost
human groan of pain, sank to the ground. At
the same time Ramon, halted on the little hill,
caught the sound of the crash.</p>

<p>A cruel smile curled his thin lips, exposing his
long yellow teeth&mdash;almost like those of some beast
of prey. With a whispered word to his black
horse the Mexican outlaw plunged into the brush
in the direction of the sound which had just
reached his ears.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">A BATTLE ROYAL.</p>

<p>Jack struggled to his feet and surveyed the
scene of his disaster with dismay. A brief examination
of his fallen horse told him that it
would be impossible to continue his flight on the
animal. Its knees were cut and bruised, and it
lay with an expression of dumb suffering in its
eyes that touched the sorely-tried lad’s heart. If
he had not dropped his little rifle in the excitement
of his escape he would have despatched the
creature,&mdash;risking the chance of detection from
the sound of the report.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s where I take to Shank’s mare,”
murmured Jack, setting off once more,&mdash;when
something whistled through the air and settled
about his neck in a stifling coil.</p>

<p>It was a rawhide lasso, hurled with deadly accuracy
by Ramon, who had entered the glade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
just as Jack arose from his examination of the
fallen horse.</p>

<p>Before the boy had time to realize what had
occurred, he was yanked from his feet and
thrown violently to the ground for the second
time.</p>

<p>“So I’ve got you fast and tight, at last, eh,”
sneered Ramon vindictively, gazing down from
his great horse at the crestfallen, dust-covered
boy.</p>

<p>“Well, my young senor,” he continued, with a
vicious intonation, “I can promise you that this
time you will not escape so easily. This will be
a treat for the boys.”</p>

<p>Jack answered nothing. He struggled to rise
but the rope was given a jerk by his captor which
brought him to the ground once more. He could
almost have cried with humiliation. At the moment
this was his overmastering feeling. Of
fear he felt little, but he would have given a lot
just then to stand up with Black Ramon in a
twenty-four-foot ring!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Having “thrown” poor Jack very much as he
might have done a refractory calf, the outlaw
turned his attention to the injured horse.</p>

<p>“So you have ruined one of our horses, too,
you Yankee pig,” he snarled; “well, it only makes
one more score to settle up with you.”</p>

<p>He drew one of his big revolvers from its
chased leather holster, and carefully aiming it,
shot the mortally injured animal between the
eyes. The creature gave a convulsive shudder
and straightened out,&mdash;dead. Without another
word Ramon swung his black around, and before
he could make a move Jack found himself being
dragged over the rough ground at a swift pace.
Within a few yards his side was bruised and cut,
and the clothing torn from him.</p>

<p>“Great heavens, if this keeps up I shall be
unable to move hand or foot,” thought Jack in
dismay.</p>

<p>For a moment his heart failed him, and then
he suddenly bethought himself of his knife. To
reach it in his side pocket&mdash;for his arms were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
partially free,&mdash;was the work of an instant, and
with one quick slash he cut the rawhide that
bound him.</p>

<p>Released of its burden thus suddenly, the sure-footed
black lost its footing and almost stumbled.</p>

<p>“Diablo!” Jack heard Ramon shrill out as the
Border Boy gave one quick leap into the dense
woods.</p>

<p>When Ramon looked around there was not a
trace of the lad he had had at the end of his
lariat. Instead, a broken end of the rope dangled
on the ground, its ends frayed out.</p>

<p>“Maledictions!” he yelled, all the fury of his
Latin blood boiling to the surface in an ungovernable
flood. “That cursed gringo pup has
fooled me once more.”</p>

<p>In one of those meaningless frenzies of rage
into which his countrymen are apt to fall when
thwarted in anything, Ramon began to vent his
rage on the first animate object to hand. This
was the black horse. On the beautiful creature’s
shiny coat the cruel blows of the Mexican’s lariat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fell furiously, raising great welts across the
glossy surface.</p>

<p>For an instant the black quivered and stood
motionless. The suddenness of the attack dazed
it. But the next moment, its rage,&mdash;as ungoverned
as that of its master, surged up in its
equine heart. With an angry squeal it gave a
succession of huge bucks which would have unseated
any ordinary&mdash;or extraordinary rider,&mdash;but
which did not even disturb the Mexican’s
seat.</p>

<p>Then followed a magnificent exhibition of man
versus horse. And it was not without its watchers&mdash;this
Homeric struggle for supremacy between
maddened man and maddened beast.</p>

<p>Jack, from his hiding place in the ferns and
brush, heard the sounds and almost unconsciously
he drew closer to the scene of the combat. Parting
the ferns he peered through cautiously, and
then was held spellbound.</p>

<p>If he were to have been captured for it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
next instant he could not have withdrawn his
gaze from the spectacle.</p>

<p>With clenched teeth and face that was yellow
and drawn with rage, Ramon plied quirt and
spur. The big rowelled instruments he wore
tore great streaks in the black’s glossy hide. All
the time his quirt fell in a perfect hailstorm of
blows about the noble animal’s flanks.</p>

<p>But if Ramon’s rage was impressive from its
very vindictiveness, how much more so was the
just anger of the big horse.</p>

<p>Its delicately pointed ears were pressed close
back to its shapely head, while its eye gleamed
whitely. As the big silver-mounted bit of the
barbarous Mexican pattern cut and gored its
sensitive mouth, the animal champed and snapped,&mdash;like
a rabid dog,&mdash;till its great chest was flecked
with blood and foam. But it was unsubdued, as
unconquered as its master.</p>

<p>“By George, what a rider!” was the involuntary
exclamation of admiration forced from Jack
as he watched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>And the next moment.</p>

<p>“Gracious, what a horse!”</p>

<p>Suddenly the black reared straight upward,
beating the air with its forelegs. For a breath
it swayed and balanced perfectly, and then,
losing its equilibrium&mdash;perhaps purposely&mdash;it fell
backward.</p>

<p>A cry of alarm broke, against his will, from
Jack’s whitened lips. Ramon’s death seemed
certain. But instead of the black crushing his
body in its fall, the agile Mexican was out of the
saddle with the agility of an eel, and as the black
leaped erect once more its master was back in
the saddle breathing fresh maledictions and flogging
and rowelling more unmercifully than ever.</p>

<p>But from that time on, there was no question
but that the animal realized that it had met its
match. Its bucks were no longer great, animated,
splendid leaps, driven by the force of its
powerful muscles. Instead, they were limp and
dispirited.</p>

<p>But Ramon seemed bent on thoroughly humiliating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the animal. Jack’s blood began to boil
as he saw the brutal punishment increasing in
violence as the black grew more and more subjugated.
Its sunken flanks heaved, its limbs
trembled and actual tears rolled down its cheeks;
but Ramon still flogged and beat and spurred as
furiously as ever.</p>

<p>“Oh, that such a rider should be such a brute!”
thought Jack, watching the scene from his place
of concealment.</p>

<p>“This has got to stop,” he determined the next
instant. So great was his anger at the brutal
exhibition that had he had his small rifle he
would almost have risked crippling one of the
Mexican’s arms or legs in order to end the sickening
brutality.</p>

<p>But if Jack had not a rifle, he had another
weapon perhaps even more efficacious in his
hands. It will be recalled that Jack had performed
some remarkable feats of pitching at
Stonefell College, notably in the great game between
West Point and Stonefell. What more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
natural then than that he should select from the
plenty about him, a small, well-rounded stone,
somewhat smaller than a league ball.</p>

<p>Feeling sure that Ramon was too intent on his
punishment to notice anything else, Jack stepped
boldly to the edge of the little clearing, and with
a preliminary twist he sent the stone hurtling
straight and true at the head of the black’s tormentor.</p>

<p>Like a tree that has felt the woodsman’s axe,
Ramon threw up his hands as the stone struck
him, and without a sound pitched out of the saddle,
crashing in a heap on the ground.</p>

<p>Jack felt rather alarmed as he saw this. He
had not intended to throw quite so hard. For
an instant a dreadful fear that he had killed
Ramon&mdash;rascal though the man was,&mdash;clutched
at his heart.</p>

<p>Coming boldly out from his place of concealment
he hastened to the fallen man’s side.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">CAUGHT IN A TRAP.</p>

<p>But Ramon was not dead,&mdash;far from it, in
fact. As Jack bent above him he reached back,
and with a swift, cat-like motion, whipped out a
knife and, balancing it on his palm for the fraction
of a second, sent it whistling past the lad’s
ear.</p>

<p>Before he could rise the boy was upon him,
and for a space of several minutes they struggled
on the uneven ground, the exhausted horse looking
disinterestedly on. Had it not been for its
recent punishment it is likely that the brute might
have interfered, for some of the oft told tales
along the border concerned the black’s love for
its master. But as it was, it made no move, not
even when Jack, holding Ramon pinned to the
ground with one hand, with the other jerked
loose the lasso from the saddle, by its hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
end, and rapidly proceeded to bind the Mexican
fast.</p>

<p>“Adios, Ramon!” cried the boy, as, his task
completed, he turned away.</p>

<p>Had the black horse not been so completely
worn out it is likely that Jack might have commandeered
him. But as it was, he deemed it
wisest not to bother with him.</p>

<p>And so he slipped away, leaving the exhausted
horse and helpless master side by side.</p>

<p>After traveling some distance Jack began to
realize that his woodcraft was seriously at fault
somewhere. He had intended to make a detour
which would bring him around the outlaw’s
camp and enable him to reach their own bivouac
unobserved.</p>

<p>Instead of this, as he now began to dread, he
had apparently headed altogether in the wrong
direction, for the country into which he emerged
after traversing the fern-brake and scrub-coppice,
was of a kind distinctly foreign to anything
they had as yet encountered in Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost bare of vegetation, it was riven and
split as if by volcanic action. The earth was of
a reddish color, as if it had been seared by elemental
fires, and the beetling cliffs rose threateningly
on either side.</p>

<p>“What a gloomy place,” thought Jack, “it reminds
me of that valley in which Sinbad the
Sailor found the snakes and the diamonds. Wonder
if there are any diamonds here? Tell you
what, though, I’d give a whole handful of the
gems right now for a good square meal.”</p>

<p>The thought of the appetizing breakfast which
had been preparing when he left camp made
Jack hungrier than ever, a fact which he had
not had time heretofore to realize in the rapid
march of events which had occurred since his
departure.</p>

<p>The Border Boy looked about him carefully.
He realized that if not actually lost, he was in
grave danger of being so. The thought quickened
his faculties and he set about gauging his
position in real earnest. Having, by the aid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the sun, calculated the direction in which the
Border Boys’ camp ought to lie, Jack struck out
for it. His way led him across a corner of The
Baked Land, as he had mentally christened the
dreary valley.</p>

<p>He was hastening forward when, suddenly,
as he stepped into what seemed a patch of ferns
and high grass, the solid ground seemed to vanish
from under his feet.</p>

<p>Straight down shot the Border Boy, clutching
desperately, as he fell, at projecting rocks and
bits of growth; but none of these remained firm
in his grasp.</p>

<p>For twenty feet or more the boy fell, and then
suddenly his drop was arrested by a heap of
dried vegetation at the bottom of the pit or
crevasse into which his hurrying feet had led
him.</p>

<p>So well had the deceitful growth on the edges
of this gulf hidden it, that it was small wonder
that Jack, in his haste, had not perceived it. It
was dark with a gloomy, damp sort of dusk in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the bottom of the crevasse, only a dim, greenish
light filtering in from the top.</p>

<p>The reaction from his hopes of a few minutes
before almost unnerved the lad for the nonce,
but presently he marshalled his faculties and set
himself to the task of ascertaining exactly what
had happened to him, and what means of escape
presented itself.</p>

<p>At a single glance he could see that there was
no hope of getting out of the subterranean trap
by means of climbing up the walls. Although
they were rough and might have afforded a foothold,
they overhung the floor of the pit at such
an angle that even a fly would have found it difficult
to maintain a foothold on them.</p>

<p>Yet rescue himself he must, or face death in
that gloomy place. Without any definite idea in
his mind, Jack struck off along the bottom of the
abyss, which was overgrown with a short, coarse
sort of grass of a pallid green color.</p>

<p>As he moved along his progress was suddenly
arrested. His foot had encountered something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that wriggled and squirmed horribly under his
sole. It was a sickening sensation, this, of feeling
that squirmy mass under his foot.</p>

<p>Jack stepped hastily back. As he did so something
brown and mottled slid off through the
grass, hissing angrily. As it went there came a
dry sort of sound, like the rattling of peas in a
bladder. At the same time a nauseating musky
odor filled the air.</p>

<p>“This place may be alive with rattlers!”
thought Jack, glancing nervously about him.</p>

<p>As he spoke he thought that from a dark corner
at the further end of the rocky pit he could
hear a sort of scuffling and rustling, unpleasantly
suggestive of intertwined masses of scaly bodies
writhing and contorting in snaky knots. At any
rate, he decided to explore the rift no further in
that direction. Instead, he turned back and sitting
down on a projecting bit of rock,&mdash;after first
carefully reviewing the surroundings,&mdash;Jack set
himself to some hard thinking.</p>

<p>If only he had possessed a rifle or a revolver,&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
even a knife,&mdash;his situation would have been
different. By firing the weapons he might have
attracted attention to his dilemma, and with the
knife it might have been feasible to cut steps in
the walls at some other part of the crevasse.</p>

<p>Then, too, there is something in the mere feel
of the good wood and steel of a rifle that gives a
fellow confidence and courage. It seems like a
friend or at least a protector. But poor Jack
had none of this comfort He was trapped in
the bowels of the earth with only his bare hands
to aid him out of his difficulties.</p>

<p>As it was unthinkable to dream of exploring
the pit further in the direction in which he felt
sure lay the den of snakes, Jack finally decided on
striking off the other way. That he went carefully,
you may be sure. He did not want again
to experience that wriggly, crawly feeling under
his foot.</p>

<p>The crevasse seemed to be of considerable
length. In fact, he estimated that he had walked
some half mile or more before he reached what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
seemed to be its confines. It ended abruptly in
a steep wall of rock, and with its termination
Jack’s hopes of escape vanished also. Fairly
unnerved, the boy sank down on a heap of dried
fern and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Was he to be buried alive in this horrible
place?</p>

<p>Then he fell to shouting. He yelled and hulloed
till his throat was dry and sore, and his lips
cracked. He knew that he ran considerable risk
of attracting the attention of the outlaws, but
in his present predicament he didn’t much care
what happened so long as he got out of the terrible
place. But all his shouting came to naught,
and after an interval of waiting Jack realized that
it had all been in vain.</p>

<p>What was he to do next? Nothing but to wait
for rescue or&mdash;&mdash; But Jack would not allow
himself to complete the sentence.</p>

<p>“While there is life there is hope,” he murmured
to himself, and involuntarily recalled the
night when he had stood upon the tower of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
old mission, a hundred feet above the ground, and
deemed that his end had come. Yet he had
escaped from that dilemma, and more impossible
things had happened than that he should get out
of his present scrape alive.</p>

<p>All at once, while he sat thus meditating, the
boy spied, not far above his head and only a short
distance away, a dangling vine some two inches
in circumference, and seemingly tough and
fibrous.</p>

<p>“It ought to bear my weight,” thought Jack,
“and if only it will, I’ll get out of this hideous
place yet.”</p>

<p>He began making brave efforts to reach the
trailing tendon. Time and again, with hands
that were cut and bleeding from the rough surface
of the rock, he was compelled to desist in
his efforts, but at last, mustering his waning
strength, he made a mighty leap. His fingers
closed on the vine and he drew himself upward.
But as the boy’s full weight came upon the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
trailer it snapped abruptly, and Jack was thrown
violently to the ground.</p>

<p>He fell with such force that he was stunned
and helpless. Clasping the broken bit of treacherous
vine in his hands, the Border Boy lay on
the floor of the crevasse, senseless.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN EXCITING QUEST.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the keenest anxiety prevailed
in the camp. After awaiting breakfast for a long
time, it was at last eaten and the tin dishes
scoured, without there being any sign of the
missing boy.</p>

<p>“We must organize a search at once,” declared
the professor. “Following on the top of that
warning last night, it begins to look ominous.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he has lost himself, and will find his
way back before long,” suggested Ralph hopefully.</p>

<p>Coyote Pete gloomily shook his head.</p>

<p>“Jack Merrill ain’t that kind,” he said; “I tell
yer, I don’t like the looks of it.”</p>

<p>“Why not fire guns so that if he is in the vicinity
he can hear them?” was Walt Phelps’ suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yep, and bring the whole hornets’ nest down
on our ears, provided they are anywhar near,”
grunted Coyote Pete. “No younker, we will have
to think up a better way than that.”</p>

<p>“Would not the search party I suggested be
the best plan?” put in the professor.</p>

<p>“Reckon it would,” agreed Coyote Pete; “what
you kain’t find, look fur,&mdash;as the flea said to ther
monkey.”</p>

<p>But nobody laughed, as they usually did, at
Pete’s quaintly phrased observations. There was
too much anxiety felt by them all over Jack’s unexplained
absence.</p>

<p>“Shall we take the horses?” inquired Walt.</p>

<p>“Sartin, sure,” was the cow-puncher’s rejoinder,
“don’t want ter leave ’em here for that
letter writer and his pals to gobble up.”</p>

<p>So the stock was saddled and the pack burros
loaded and “diamond hitched,” and the mournful
and anxious little party got under way. It
so chanced that their way led them to the little
hill where Jack had stopped on the stolen horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and listened for sounds of the pursuit. Coyote’s
sharp eyes at once spied the tracks, but naturally
he could make nothing of them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ralph Stetson, who had ridden a
little in advance, gave a startled cry.</p>

<p>“Come here, all!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“What’s up now?” grunted Coyote Pete, spurring
forward, followed by the others.</p>

<p>“Why, here’s a horse,&mdash;a dead horse, shot
through the head, lying here,” was the unexpected
reply.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Coyote, what do you make of it?”
asked the professor, after Pete had carefully
surveyed the ground in the vicinity.</p>

<p>“Dunno what ter make uv it yit,” snorted Pete.
“Looks like ther’s something back of this, as
the cat said when she looked in the mirror, and&mdash;wow!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” they chorused as they pressed
about the spot where Coyote was pointing downward,
an unusual expression of excitement on
his ordinarily unemotional features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“See that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see several footsteps,” said the professor,
“but what have they&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ter do with it? Everything. Them’s Jack
Merrill’s footmarks or I lose my guess. And see
here, this little wavy line,&mdash;a lariat’s dragged
here. Oh, the varmints!”</p>

<p>“How do you construe all this?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Easy enuff. Them rascals, whoever they
be, hev roped Jack, hog-tied him and dragged him
off.”</p>

<p>“O-oh!”</p>

<p>The exclamation, half a groan, burst from all
their throats. Examining the ground further, it
seemed likely that Coyote’s construction of the
case was a correct one. All of which goes to
show how very far wrong a theory can go.</p>

<p>“Let’s hurry after them, whoever they are,
and put up a fight,” cried Ralph.</p>

<p>“Yes, we must rescue Jack,” echoed Walt
Phelps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, hold your broncs, youngsters,” warned
Coyote, “in the fust place we dunno how many
of them there be, and in the second we dunno
jus’ whar they air. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes,” said the professor. “Boys, you
should not be so impetuous. Julius Caesar, when
he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dunno the gent,” struck in Pete, “but my
advice is to kind of hunt around this vicinity and
maybe we’ll find some more clews. Go easy,
now, boys, and make as little noise as possible.”</p>

<p>A few moments later the ashes of the camp
fire near which Jack had so suddenly alighted
were found, but of the outlaws no trace remained.
As a matter of fact, Ramon’s shouts had attracted
them, and as soon as they had rescued him the
camp had been abandoned in a hurry. It did not
suit Ramon just then to try conclusions with the
Border Boys.</p>

<p>“Wall, here’s whar they camped,” muttered
Coyote Pete, “we certainly had some close neighbors
last night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys examined the camp site with interest,
while the professor and Coyote Pete conversed
earnestly apart. At the conclusion of
their confab, Coyote Pete spoke.</p>

<p>“It’s up to us to go forward, boys,” he said.
“Ain’t no use lingering ’bout these diggin’s.”</p>

<p>“But mayn’t the bad men have turned back
down the canyon?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p>Coyote shook his head.</p>

<p>“Think agin, son,” he admonished, “the floor
of the gulch is too narrow for ’em to hev got by
us without our knowing it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Walt, while Ralph colored
up a bit. He didn’t like to be looked upon as a
tenderfoot.</p>

<p>It was some time later that they reached the
volcanic-looking stretch of country into the pitfalls
of which Jack had fallen.</p>

<p>“Ugh! What a dreary place!” stammered
Walt, a bit apprehensively.</p>

<p>Somehow they all felt the oppressive gloom
in the same way. It depressed and made them silent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
When they spoke at all it was in hushed
tones, like folks use in church or a big museum.
This is the effect of most awe-inspiring scenery,
be it beautiful and grand, or merely gloomy and
threatening.</p>

<p>“In past ages volcanic energy was at work
here,” said the professor, gazing about with interest;
“the formation of yonder cliffs tells an
interesting story to the scientist. I wish my geological
hammer was not in the packs, and I could
get some specimens of the rocks. They would be
excessively interesting.”</p>

<p>“Not half so interesting ter me as a peek
at Jack Merrill,” grunted Pete. “I wish your
science was capable of finding that lad for us,
professor.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I wish so, too,” sighed the professor,
“but that is outside the realm of science. She
can tell you of the past but is silent as to the
future.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if there are any volcanoes ’round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
about here now?” asked Ralph, looking about
rather apprehensively.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, the fires are long extinct,” declared
the professor, “this valley was formed at
a remote period when no doubt hot water geysers
and fires spouted through the earth’s crust. But
that will never occur again. In fact&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Look! Look there!” shouted Walt, suddenly
pointing off to one side of the valley.</p>

<p>“By Jee-hos-o-phat&mdash;smoke!” yelled Pete,
fairly startled out of his usual composure.</p>

<p>“A volcano!” cried Walt “Hadn’t we better
be getting away from here?”</p>

<p>“This is most extraordinary,” exclaimed the
man of science, “there is every evidence here
that the internal fires have been long extinct and
yet, as if to confound us, smoke comes pouring
from that fissure yonder.”</p>

<p>“Wall, my vote is that we git right out of
hyar quick,” declared Pete, “volcanoes and Peter
de Peyster never did agree.”</p>

<p>But the professor, filled with scientific ardor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
was already spurring his bony animal across the
scarred and arid plain toward the smoke.</p>

<p>The others, watching him, saw him approach
the fissure carefully and dismount. The next
instant he uttered a yell that startled them all.</p>

<p>“Hez ther fireworks started?” asked Coyote
anxiously.</p>

<p>The professor was waving his bony arms
around like one of those wooden figures that you
see on barns. He was evidently in a state of
great excitement.</p>

<p>“What’s that he’s shouting?” asked Walt.
“Hark!”</p>

<p>“Boys! boys! I’ve found him&mdash;Jack!”</p>

<p>This was the cry that galvanized them all into
action. Without seeking for explanations, in
fact, without a word, they spurred toward the
professor’s side. They found him peering down
into the fissure, the edge of which was concealed
by grass and ferns. Craning their necks, they,
too, could spy a figure in the depths of the crevasse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jack! Jack, old boy! Are you all right?”
they cried anxiously.</p>

<p>“Bright and fair!” came up the cheery answer,
“but almost dead. I thought you’d never come.
Got anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Anything your little heart desires,” Walt assured
him.</p>

<p>In the meantime Pete had been busy getting a
lariat in trim to lower to the beleaguered boy.
Presently it was ready, and after much hauling
and struggling, they got their companion once
more to the surface. Jack reeled for an instant
as he gained the brink, but Ralph’s arms caught
him. The next minute he had recovered his self-possession,
however, and after eating ravenously
of such provisions as could be got together hastily,
he related the story of the strange things
that had happened to him since leaving camp
that morning.</p>

<p>“If I hadn’t thought of those matches in my
pocket and of igniting a fire of that dried grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I doubt if I’d have been here now,” he concluded.</p>

<p>“I think you are right,” said the professor
gravely, “I am glad that that fire at least was
not extinct.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CLOUDBURST.</p>

<p>Our adventurers, after a council of war, decided
to press right on. As Coyote Pete put it:</p>

<p>“We’ve got a plumb duty ter perform and
we’ll see the game through, if it’s agreeable to
all present.”</p>

<p>It was, and after Jack had fully recovered,
which, aided by his natural buoyancy, did not
take as long as might have been expected, the
start was made.</p>

<p>“It’s a race for the Trembling Mountain, now,”
cried Jack, as he once more bestrode brave little
Firewater.</p>

<p>“So it is,” cried Walt Phelps.</p>

<p>“And may the best man win,” struck in Ralph
rather pointlessly, as Pete reminded him.</p>

<p>“There’s only one bunch of best men on this
trip,” he said, “and they’re all with this party.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>It did not take long to leave the dreary volcanic
valley behind them, and they soon emerged
on a rolling plain covered with plumed grasses
of a rich bluish-green hue, on the further margin
of which there hung like dim blue clouds, a
range of mountains.</p>

<p>“There is our goal,” cried the professor, with
what was for him a dramatic gesture. He waved
his arm in the direction of the distant hills.</p>

<p>“Yip-yip-y-e-e-e!” exploded the boys, in a regular
cowboy yell.</p>

<p>“A race to that hummock yonder!” shouted
Jack.</p>

<p>The others needed no urging. After their
rough journey among the mountains the ponies,
too, seemed to enter into the pleasure of traversing
this broad open savannah.</p>

<p>Off they dashed, hoofs a-rattling and dust
a-flying. But it was Firewater’s race from the
start. The lithe little pony easily distanced the
others, and Jack, laughing and panting, drew
rein at the goal a good ten seconds before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
others tore up with quirts and spurs going furiously.
Jack decided it was a dead heat between
Walt and Ralph, and both declared themselves
satisfied.</p>

<p>As the sun dropped lower, and hung like a red
ball above the distant mountains, the question
of finding a suitable camping place became an
urgent one. Finally, however, on reaching the
dried-up bed of a river, Coyote Pete decided that
they had reached the proper spot.</p>

<p>“What about water?” inquired Walt rather
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Plenty of that,” said Pete, sententiously.</p>

<p>They looked about at the dry sand and rocks
in the river bed and at the waving grass on either
hand.</p>

<p>“You must have splendid eyesight,” laughed
Ralph, “I don’t see a drop, unless it’s in those
clouds ’way off there above the mountains.”</p>

<p>“I, too, must confess that I’m puzzled,” put in
the professor. “A more arid spot I have rarely
seen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wall, I’ll guarantee that if you dig down a
few feet right hyar you’ll get all the water you
want,” said Coyote Pete calmly.</p>

<p>“Soon proved,” cried Ralph, and aided by
Walt he unpacked one of the burros and the two
lads selected long-handled shovels.</p>

<p>How the dirt did fly then! Maybe it was an
accident, and then again maybe it wasn’t, when
the professor, deeply immersed in a book he carried
in his pocket, found himself the center of
a regular gravel storm. He hastily moved out
of the radius of the energetic diggers. But presently
a loud cry from them announced a discovery.</p>

<p>“Struck oil?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Better still,&mdash;water!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, from the steep sides of the big
holes they had dug, water was beginning to ooze.
It was brownish in hue, alkaline in taste and
distinctly warm, but still it was water, and men,
boys and beasts drank eagerly of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>But it ran in very slowly, and, as Jack observed,
it was a long time between drinks.</p>

<p>“Wish some of that rain off in the mountains
would strike hereabouts,” observed Walt, as they
sat down to supper.</p>

<p>“How do you know it’s raining off there?”
asked Ralph belligerently.</p>

<p>“I can see the dark clouds, Mister Smarty, and
also, I have observed the fact that lightning is
flashing among them.”</p>

<p>“Hear the thunder, too, I suppose?” asked
Ralph sardonically.</p>

<p>“Might if my ears were as big as yours,”
parried Walt.</p>

<p>Immediate hostilities were averted by the professor,
who said:</p>

<p>“Boys! boys! Let us change the subject.”</p>

<p>“The ears, you mean,” muttered Walt, but he
didn’t say it out loud, and the meal passed off
merrily after the little passage-at-arms. As it
grew dark, they could see the lightning flashes
in the far distance quite distinctly. It had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
weird effect, this sudden coming and departure
of blue flares on the horizon. Against the radiance
the serrated outlines of the mountains stood
out as if they had been cut from cardboard.</p>

<p>“Going to set a watch to-night?” asked Ralph,
as they sat about a fire formed of the tough
fibrous roots of the tufted grass, which was
really more of a shrub.</p>

<p>“Of course,” rejoined Coyote, “we don’t know
whether them varmints of Ramon’s is ahead or
ahind, but wherever they are, if we don’t watch
out, they’ll do us all the mischief they can.”</p>

<p>“Reckon that’s right,” agreed Ralph, “there’s
one good thing, though, they can’t very well creep
up on us here.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s one advantage of an open camp,”
agreed Jack, “on the other hand, though, we
might have a job defending ourselves if attacked.”</p>

<p>More discussion, none of which would be of
vital interest to record here, followed. But it
did not last long. Thoroughly tired out as our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
adventurers were, they one by one sought their
blankets and the camp was soon wrapped in silence.
That is, if the snores of some of the
members of the party be excepted. But Coyote,
who was on watch, was not bothered with sensitive
nerves, and the noise disturbed him not a
whit.</p>

<p>It was about midnight, and time for the plainsman
to call Jack and Ralph to relieve him on
guard, when a most peculiar sound arrested him
in the act of crossing to the sleeping lads’ sides.</p>

<p>The noise which had attracted his attention
was a most unusual, an almost awe-inspiring one.
Coming from no definite quarter, it yet filled the
air with an omnipresent rumbling and roaring,
not unlike,&mdash;so it flashed into Coyote’s mind,&mdash;the
reverberating rumble of an express train.</p>

<p>“But they ain’t no night mails crossing this
savannah as I ever heard on,” he thought.</p>

<p>“Jumping bob cats!” he fairly howled the next
instant.</p>

<p>In two bounds he reached the sleepers’ sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and fairly shouted and shook them into wakefulness.</p>

<p>“What is it, Indians?” cried Jack, springing
erect.</p>

<p>“Another bear!” gasped the professor.</p>

<p>“It ain’t neither. It’s worser th’n both!” was
Coyote’s alarming, if oddly expressed, rejoinder.</p>

<p>As he spoke the roaring became louder, closer,
more ominous.</p>

<p>Through the darkness they could now see that
rushing toward them down the dry river bed was
a mighty line of white. In the very indefiniteness
of its form there was something that gripped
them all with a cold chill of alarm, the keener
for its very lack of understanding of the nature
of the approaching mass. Ralph snatched up a
rifle, but Coyote, seizing his arm, checked him in
a flash.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that, son. It’s not a mite of good,”
he cried, and then the next instant:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Run for your lives, everybody! Thar’s bin a
cloudburst in ther mountains, and here comes
ther gosh darndest flood since Noah’s!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">ADRIFT ON THE DESERT.</p>

<p>The consternation which Coyote’s words
caused may be imagined. The Border Boys
hastily snatched up what they could, and with
Professor Wintergreen sprinting beside them,
they dashed off, making for the higher ground
off to the right of their camping place. Behind
them came the wall of white, angry water, uplifting
its snowy crest gleamingly through the
darkness.</p>

<p>But suddenly Jack stopped short.</p>

<p>“Here, take these,” he exclaimed, thrusting his
rifle and blankets into Ralph’s hands.</p>

<p>Before the other could reply Jack was off into
the night, sprinting away as he had not done
since the field meet at Stonefell, when he won that
memorable two hundred yard dash. The lad had
suddenly recollected, and bitterly censured himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
for it, too, that in the first flash of panic he
had entirely forgotten to turn their stock loose.
Tethered as they were, the animals would be
drowned and the party helpless, unless the creatures
were set free to swim for their lives, or
gallop off before the flood.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it was not far, as the animals
were staked out some distance below the camp
and in the general direction in which the active
lads had been fleeing.</p>

<p>As he ran, Jack felt for and found his knife,
a big-bladed, heavily-handled affair. Reaching
the ponies’ sides, he hastily slashed, with heavy
sweeps of his stout blade, one after another of
the tethers. The animals, super-sensitive to approaching
danger, were already wildly excited,
and as their halter lines parted one after another,
they dashed off madly.</p>

<p>The last animal for Jack to reach was Firewater.
But the pony, instead of dashing off like
the others, nuzzled close to Jack, shivering and
sweating in an extremity of terror. Do what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
he could, Jack could not get him to move. All
at once the boy threw a quick glance behind as
a rapid footstep sounded.</p>

<p>“Coyote!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yep, Jack, it’s that same dern fool,” cried the
cow-puncher, “I see you had brains enough to do
what I orter done afore we started on the run.”</p>

<p>“No time to talk about that now,” exclaimed
Jack. “Look behind you.”</p>

<p>“Gee whillakers, boy, the flood’s upon us!”</p>

<p>Jack’s reply was to spring upon Firewater’s
back.</p>

<p>“Here, Pete! Up behind me, quick!”</p>

<p>“Go on, Jack, and get away; I’ll take my
chances.”</p>

<p>“Not much you won’t! Get up quick, now!”</p>

<p>The lad extended a foot. Pete rested his
weight on it for a flash and the next instant was
mounted behind Jack.</p>

<p>“Yip-ee-ee-ee!” shrilled the boy, driving home
his heels into the pony’s flanks.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Firewater, balky no longer, gave a mad leap
forward. Behind them roared the oncoming
flood.</p>

<p>“Make for the high ground!” shouted Pete,
“it’s our only chance.”</p>

<p>Jack made no reply, but bent lower over Firewater’s
withers, urging the gallant little pony on.
But suddenly their flight was checked. And that,
too, just as they had reached the comparative
safety of the higher ground on the banks of the
dry water course which had become so suddenly
converted into a menace.</p>

<p>Firewater stuck his foot into a pocket-gopher
hole. He struggled bravely to maintain his footing,
but what with the heavy load he was carrying
and the speed at which he had been suddenly
halted, the pony lost his equilibrium. The next
instant Jack and Coyote were on the ground while
Firewater, thoroughly scared now, dashed off,
whinnying wildly in his terror.</p>

<p>Pete, too, was up in a flash, but Jack lay quite
still. The force of the fall had stunned him.
The cow-puncher caught him up in a jiffy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
set off clumsily, running from the menace behind
with the unconscious boy in his arms.</p>

<p>But like most men whose lives have been spent
in the saddle in our great west, Pete was an
indifferent runner. Then, too, his heavy leather
“chaps,” which he had not removed while on
watch, hampered him.</p>

<p>Before he had run ten yards the onrush of
water was upon him and his senseless burden.
The irresistible force of the flood swept him from
his feet in a flash and bore him on its swirling
surface like a chip or a straw. But half stunned,
choked and dazed as he was, the cow-puncher
clung to Jack. How long he could have continued
to do so is doubtful, and this story might
have had a far different termination. But something
that occurred just at that instant deprived
Pete of further responsibility in the matter.</p>

<p>Something struck him a sudden blow in the
back of the head and a thousand lights instantly
surged and danced before his eyes. As he lost
consciousness, Pete felt himself seized by what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
appeared to be a mass of rough arms or tentacles,
and lifted bodily from his feet. Then everything
faded from his senses.</p>

<p>When he recovered it was broad daylight and
Jack was bending over him. Sick and weak as
the rugged cow-puncher felt as his senses rushed
back like an arrested tide, he could not forbear
smiling as he gazed at the lad.</p>

<p>Jack’s costume was, to say the least, an airy
one. It consisted in fact, of part of his night
clothing, badly torn, and a pair of boots which
he had just had time to put on in the hurried
retreat from the camp.</p>

<p>The boy saw the smile and guessed its reason.
But the smile was speedily replaced by a more
serious expression as Pete sat up and at once
sought to have explained to him just what had
happened.</p>

<p>“Something that felt like one of them octopusses
you read about, gripped me, and that’s
about all I can recall,” he said; “what came
next?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hardly know much more about that than
you,” was Jack’s response, “except that when I
recovered my senses after that spill that Firewater
gave us I found myself half drowned, all
tangled up in the roots of a big tree that the flood
was hurrying along. Feeling about me the first
thing I discovered was you, and I can tell you I
was mighty glad, too, Pete, old boy. No, don’t
glare at me. I know,&mdash;or can guess,&mdash;that it
was you who saved my life after Firewater threw
us both off and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No more of that, youngster,” snorted Pete
sternly, although his eyes were filled with an odd
moisture. “I reckon it was the old tree yonder
that saved us both. We were both struggling in
the flood when it hit me and put me to sleep for a
while. It’s a good thing it came on roots first
or we might not have bin so chipper this partic’lar
A. M.”</p>

<p>They both regarded the tree to which they
probably owed their lives. A big stick of timber
of the pine variety, and evidently of mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
growth, it lay a short distance from them just
as the flood had left it stranded. For the cloudburst
over, the water had sunk in the dry river
bed as rapidly as it had arisen. Hardly a foot of
muddy liquid now remained in the river to show
the aftermath of the wild watercourse of the
night.</p>

<p>“But now, what has become of the others?”
exclaimed Jack anxiously. “I hope they are all
right.”</p>

<p>“I guess so, son,” said Pete, rising rather
weakly to his feet, for the blow the tree had
struck him, while it had not broken the skin, had
been a stunning one.</p>

<p>“You see,” he went on, “they got a good start
of us and should have reached the high ground
afore the water hit.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Jack, “and I can see now
that the water did not rise so very high. It was
its speed and anger that made it terrible.”</p>

<p>“Wonder how far that blamed old tree carried
us,” said Pete, rather anxiously. “It’s just curred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to me that if we don’t connect with the
stock and some grub pretty quick, we’ll be in a
bad fix.”</p>

<p>He gazed about him as he spoke. On every
side stretched monotonous plains covered with the
same gray-green brush as the savannah amidst
which they had camped the night before. But
the question in Pete’s mind was whether or not
it was the same plain or another altogether on
which they stood.</p>

<p>But fortunately for them, for they were not in
the mood or condition to stand hardship long,
they were not destined to remain long in doubt
as to the whereabouts of their companions. While
they were gazing anxiously into the distance
Jack’s keen eye suddenly detected a sharp flash
off to the eastward. It was as if the sun had
glinted for an instant on a bit of sharply cut diamond.
The flash was as bright as a sudden ray
of fire. The next instant it was seen no more.
But a second later it flashed up again. This time
the glitter was to be seen for a longer interval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“What on airth is it?” gasped Pete, to whom
Jack had indicated the phenomenon.</p>

<p>“Wait one moment and maybe I can tell you if
it is what I hope,” cried Jack in an excited tone.
With burning eyes he watched the distant point
of light flashing and twinkling like a vanishing
and reappearing star.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” he cried suddenly, “it’s all right!
It’s Ralph and the rest and they are all safe.
But they don’t know yet where we are.”</p>

<p>Pete gazed at the boy as if he suspected that
the stress of the night might have turned his
mind.</p>

<p>“Anything else you kin see off thar?” he asked
sardonically.</p>

<p>“Nothing but that they say the horses are all
right, and that if we see their signals we are to
send up a smoke column,” replied Jack calmly,
his countenance all aglow.</p>

<p>“Look hyar, Jack Merrill, I promised your
father ter take care of yer,” said Pete sternly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
“an’ I don’t want ter take back a raving loonertick
to him. What’s all this mean?”</p>

<p>“That Ralph is signalling with a bit of mirror,&mdash;heliographing,
they call it in the army,”
cried Jack, with a merry laugh, which rather
discomfited Pete.</p>

<p>“Wall, that may be, too,” he admitted grudgingly,
“thar sun would catch it and make it flash.
But how under ther etarnal stars kin you tell
what he’s saying?”</p>

<p>“Simple enough,” rejoined Jack; “he was making
the flashes long and short,&mdash;using the Morse
telegraph code, in fact. You know we had a
cadet corps at Stonefell to which we both belonged.
Field signalling and heliographing was
part of our camping instruction, but I guess
neither of us ever dreamed it would come in
handy in such a way as this. That certainly was
a bully idea of Ralph’s. He knew if we were
any place around we would see the flashes and be
able to read them, whereas we couldn’t have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
sighted them in the tall brush so easily and
might have missed them altogether.”</p>

<p>“Wall, what air we goin’ ter do now?” asked
Pete, rather apathetically.</p>

<p>“Do? Why, light a fire, of course. Then
they’ll see the smoke column and come over to
us with grub and the ponies.”</p>

<p>“Hum,” snorted Pete. “Got any matches?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. Haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Nary a one.”</p>

<p>“Phew!” whistled Jack. “Now we are in a
fix for certain. What can we do?”</p>

<p>“Keep your shirt&mdash;or what’s left of it&mdash;on,
son, you’ll need it,” said Pete slowly, a smile
overspreading his sun-bronzed features, “thar’s
more ways of killing cats than choking ’em ter
death with superfine cream. Likewise thar’s
more ways of lighting a fire than by using parlor
matches.”</p>

<p>Jack watched Pete wonderingly as he took out
his knife in silence and strode off to the tree.
He found a dead branch and whittling off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wet outside bark soon reached the dry interior.
This done, he cut the wood down to a stick about
two feet long and a little thicker than a stout
lead pencil. Then he hacked away at some more
of the dry wood till he had a small flat bit of
thoroughly dry timber. In this he excavated
a small hole to fit the point of the pencil-like
stick.</p>

<p>“Now git me some dry twigs from that brush
yonder,” he directed Jack, who had been gazing
on these preparations with much interest and
a dawning perception of what the old plainsman
was going to do.</p>

<p>By the time Jack was back with the twigs,&mdash;the
dryest he could find,&mdash;Pete had scraped off
a lot of sawdust-like whittlings and piled them
about the hole he had dug out. Then taking
the pencil-like stick between his palms, he inserted
its lower end in the hole, carefully heaped
the sawdust stuff about it, and began rotating it
slowly at first and then fast.</p>

<p>All at once a smell of burning wood permeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the air. From the sawdust a tiny puff of blue
smoke rolled up. Suddenly it broke into flame.</p>

<p>“Now the twigs! Quick!” cried Pete, and as
Jack gave him the dry bits of stick he piled
them on the blazing punk-wood, blowing cautiously
at the flame. In ten minutes he had a
roaring fire. But the old plainsman’s work wasn’t
finished yet. He began hacking green branches
from the tree and piling them on top of his
blaze.</p>

<p>Instantly a pillar of dun-colored, smoke, thick
and greasy, rolled upward into the still air.</p>

<p>Pete took off his leather coat and threw it
over the smoking pyre, smothering the column
of vapor.</p>

<p>“Now then, son,” he said, with the faintest
trace of triumph in his voice, “yer see that this
here hell-io-what-you-may-call ’em, ain’t ther
only trick in the plainsman’s bag. By raising
and lowering that coat you kin talk in your
Remorse thing as long as you like.”</p>

<p>“Pete, I take off my hat to you,” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Jack, feeling ashamed of the rather superior
manner he had assumed when talking of the
heliograph a while before.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, son. But take it frum yer
Uncle Dudley that we none of us know everything.
Thar’s things you kin larn from an
Injun, jus’ as I larned how ter git that fire a-goin’.”</p>

<p>Kneeling by the smoldering smoke-pile, Jack
raised and lowered the coat at long and short
intervals, forming a species of smoke telegraphy
easily readable by anyone who understood the
Morse code.</p>

<p>An hour of anxious waiting followed and then
upon the scene galloped at top speed the rest of
the adventurers bearing with them some food,
scanty but welcome, and best of all, the ponies
and one rifle.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LONE RANCHO.</p>

<p>Well, that was an odd meal, that refection of
water-soaked biscuit and canned corned beef,
with flood water as a beverage. Perhaps in
all the adventures of the Border Boys, when in
after years they came to recall them, no scene
stood out quite so strikingly.</p>

<p>For one thing, Coyote Pete alone, of the party,
possessed any sort of wardrobe. The professor
was clad in his “barber pole” pajamas. Ralph
boasted a shirt and Walt Phelps possessed the
same with the addition of a pair of socks, which
latter hardly fulfilled requirements so far as a
covering for his nether limbs was concerned.</p>

<p>From time to time the Border Boys had to
look at each other and burst out laughing. Only
the professor viewed the matter in a serious
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Suppose we should meet some ladies,” he
asked indignantly.</p>

<p>“Reckon thar ain’t many of ’em hereabouts,”
ventured Coyote, spreading a big slice of beef
on a bit of soggy bread. “The burros is ther only
representatives of the gentle sex fer a good
many miles, I opinion.”</p>

<p>The burros, relieved of their packs, which had
been swept away, wagged their ears appreciatively
at this, and continued browsing on the
short, coarse grass which grew in patches here
and there, and which the boys were delighted to
see seemed also to be palatable to the horses.</p>

<p>Ralph and the others had already related how
the terrified animals had been recaptured without
difficulty early that day. In fact, a circumstance
which has often been noted was their good
fortune, namely, that panic-stricken horses in
lonely, wild countries, will actually seek human
companionship,&mdash;provided, of course, that they
have already been domesticated. As for the burros,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
their loud “hee-haws” had resounded all
night.</p>

<p>Ralph also explained how the idea of the mirror
heliograph came to him. The lad who, as
has been explained, was a bit of a dandy, was
horrified to discover the abbreviated state of
his wardrobe. But a search of his shirt pocket
revealed his pocket-mirror with its folding brush
and comb fittings. The railroad king’s son had
at once set to work to make himself presentable
about the head at least, and was combing
his hair neatly and wondering how Jack and
Pete had fared, when the sun caught the mirror
and it flashed blindingly into his eyes. This
gave him the idea of flashing it in all directions
in the hope that the others, if within sight, would
catch its glint. Then came the happy thought
of telegraphing with the bit of glass by alternately
covering and uncovering it. The idea had
met with the warm approval of the professor
and Walt Phelps, although, perhaps, even they
had not been over sanguine of results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack at length, after the events
of the night and the following incidents had been
discussed and re-discussed, “what are we going
to do now?”</p>

<p>“Get clothes,” cried Ralph, without an instant’s
hesitation, regarding his bare legs disparagingly.</p>

<p>“By all means, yes,” agreed the professor.</p>

<p>Coyote Pete grinned.</p>

<p>“Jack,” said he, “will you be so kind as ter
step ter the telephone and tell the Blue Front
Store to send up a few samples of men’s furnishings?”</p>

<p>All but the professor burst into a roar of
laughter at this sally.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” suggested Walt Phelps, “we’re
not likely to get held up.”</p>

<p>“Not so sure about that,” said the professor,
“I have the money belt containing most of our
finances around my waist. I always sleep with
it there.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” shouted the boys, who, up to that
moment had not once thought of the important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
question of finances. It struck them now with
sobering force.</p>

<p>“By George!” cried Jack, “if it hadn’t been
for your foresight, professor, we might have been
penniless as well as wardrobeless.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Coyote Pete, “and ther
chance that you’d stand of being helped out by
the greasers would be about ther same as a snowflake
’ud have on a red-hot cook stove.”</p>

<p>“My idea is to lose no time in striking out
for a town or village where we can get some
clothes, even if they are only Mexican garments,”
announced Jack.</p>

<p>“And food, too,” put in Walt Phelps, who liked
to get his three meals a day, “we’ll be on starvation
diet if we don’t stock up on that.”</p>

<p>After more discussion it was agreed to follow
up the dry bed of the river, as the professor’s
map showed a small village some distance up a
stream which, though unnamed on the map,
seemed to be the one on whose banks they now
were. This decision reached, no time was lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in mounting. There was no saddling to be done,
for the saddles had been swept off with most of
the rest of their outfit.</p>

<p>“If you ever catch me camping in the dry
bed of a river again you are welcome to hang
me to a sour apple tree,” grumbled Walt Phelps,
as he mounted.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’m ter blame fer it all,” volunteered
Coyote Pete, “but I never thought as how that
far-off storm would affect us in the plains. That
must have bin a jim-dandy of a cloudburst.”</p>

<p>“I’d hate to have been any closer to it than
we were,” laughed Jack. “If we had been, we’d
have been going yet, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“I heard of a cloudburst once that did some
good, though,” struck in Pete; “ther thing happened
to a friend of mine in Californy. He wuz
a miner, Jefferson Blunt by name.</p>

<p>“Wall, sir, Jeff had struck such all-fired bad
luck up on the Stanislaus River that he’d about
concluded to pull out for other regions when, all
of a sudden, one night up came a storm, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the middle of it there come the all-firedest cloudburst
that Jeff had ever heard of. It picked up
his cabin and floated Jeff off down the river,
a-going like a blue streak. He thought every minute
that he’d hear Gabriel’s trumpet and see ther
golden stairs, but that little old cabin was well
built and watertight, and it floated like a boat.</p>

<p>“It must hev been hours, Jeff says, afore he
felt ther thing give a bump and stop. As soon
as he dared he opened ther door and peeked
out. He wuz in a part uv ther country he’d
never seen. It was all cliffs and big trees and
very imposing, and ther like of that,&mdash;that ‘imposing’
is Jeff’s word.</p>

<p>“Wall, Jeff he steps out of his sea-going shack
and looks about him, and ther first thing he
sees is a big streak of ore just a-glitter with
gold and stuck, like a band of yaller ribbon along
ther cliff face above his head.</p>

<p>“Jeff had bin so unlucky that first he thinks
it’s jes’ fool’s gold and not the real article. But
he soon convinces himself thet he’s struck it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
rich at last. Wall, ter make a long story short,
Jeff files a claim and in a few y’ars is a rich man,
and what d’ye s’pose he called ther mine?”</p>

<p>“‘The Cloud Burst,’ of course!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“How’d yer guess it?” asked Pete. “But yer
right, and thet’s ther only cloudburst I ever
hearn’ of, thet brought anybody any luck.”</p>

<p>“Personally, if I could find a pair of trousers,”
wailed the professor, “I should esteem their
possession almost above even such a lucky discovery
as you have related.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d trade it right now for a porter-house
steak and trimmings, brown gravy and
green corn, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“See here,” put in Ralph, with assumed indignation,
“if you don’t shut up I’ll, I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go right home,” chuckled Walt teasingly;
“you’d be a fine sight in that rig. I’ll bet the
folks back east would have you put in the calaboose.”</p>

<p>But by noon the gay spirits of the boys were
considerably toned down. No sign of a town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
had yet come in sight and they were all hot,
hungry and tired. The odd procession, with the
burros tagging along behind, looked disconsolate
enough as it followed the windings of the river.
The shallow aftermath of the flood steamed and
simmered under the hot sun, sending up unpleasant
odors,&mdash;yet they had to drink it or go
without.</p>

<p>By way of cheering the party up, Coyote Pete
began to sing&mdash;or rather wail&mdash;in the high-pitched
voice affected by cow-punchers singing
to their cattle:</p>

<p class="pp7 p1">“O-ho-wa-hay da-own upon the Su-wahanee River,<br />
Fa-har, fa-har a-way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="p1">But before he could begin the next line Ralph
struck in with:</p>

<p class="pp7 p1">“There’s where our pants are floating ever;<br />
There’s where they’re gone to stay!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In the general roar of laughter which followed,
the “grouch” which had settled down on
the tired wayfarers vanished like the spring snow
under a burst of sunlight.</p>

<p>With a shout the boys, their troubles forgotten
in an outburst of that good nature that makes
the whole world kin, plunged forward, their shirt
tails flying.</p>

<p>“Yip-yip-ye-ee!”</p>

<p>The joyous yell filled the air. And then it
broke off into a real cheer, for, on surmounting
the summit of a small eminence, they saw below
them, not more than a mile off, a small adobe
house of unusual type, for it had two stories. It
was surrounded by a grove of green willows
which delighted the eye tired by the endless
gray-green stretches of grease-wood savannahs.</p>

<p>Even the dignified professor joined in the enthusiasm,
and in a minute a cavalcade was bearing
down on the place at breakneck speed. As
they neared it in a thunder of hoofs and a cloud
of yellow dust, a door opened and the figure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a gaunt Mexican, with long, shaggy, black hair
hanging straight and lank to his shoulders,
stepped out. His next move halted the leaders
of the party abruptly.</p>

<p>He jerked a long-barreled rifle to his shoulder
and pointed it threateningly.</p>

<p>“Mira rurales!” he yelled to some one within
the house.</p>

<p>“No rurales! Americanos!” cried Coyote Pete.</p>

<p>The effect was magical. The man’s startled
air changed, and with a sheepish smile he stepped
forward as Jack and Ralph, who were in advance,
drew rein.</p>

<p>“What did he mean by rurales, I wonder?”
asked Ralph of Jack in a low tone as the others
loped up.</p>

<p>“Why, rurales are a species of police.
Rangers, they are called sometimes. They are
wild chaps, mostly recruited from the ranks of
brigands and highwaymen. The government
pays them a high figure to be good and keep law
and order.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“But this man seemed to fear them.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he has reason to. But we can’t be
particular. At any rate, we are a strong enough
party to look after our own hands. But see,
here comes his wife. I guess, after all, he is
nothing more unlawful than a cattle rancher in
a small way, who perhaps, once-in-a-while takes
an unbranded calf or two from his neighbor’s
estates.”</p>

<p>The woman who joined the man, who by this
time had set down the rifle, was a stout, slatternly-looking
creature in a greasy cotton wrapper.
She shot out a few rapid words in a low
voice to the other, who replied in equally low
tones. So far as Jack, who was closest, could
judge, the woman seemed to be protesting against
something, and the man stilling her objections.</p>

<p>Coyote Pete as spokesman now advanced, and
in Spanish asked if they could obtain lodging
and refreshment for themselves and their stock.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">AFTER MIDNIGHT.</p>

<p>To their astonishment, the man seemed to
hesitate. They had judged from the poverty-stricken
look of his place and belongings that
he would jump at the chance to make some money
easily. But it seemed that this was not the case.</p>

<p>While the fellow still hesitated, glancing covertly
at the newcomers, the professor did a foolish
thing. He exhibited his money belt and tapping
it made it give forth the suggestive jingle
of coins. Coyote Pete’s expression grew angry
for a moment, but he checked his chagrin at the
professor’s foolish move.</p>

<p>But the exhibition of the party’s financial solidity
seemed to have decided the ill-favored
Mexican and his wife, for after some more parley,
which somehow appeared to Jack to be
merely for form’s sake, they agreed to shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the party and their stock at two dollars each,
Mexican, which is equivalent to one dollar of
our money.</p>

<p>“Cheap enough,” said Jack, as ten minutes
later they turned their stock loose in the corral
and watched them attack with wholesome appetites
the hay stack in the center of the enclosure.</p>

<p>“May be dear enough before we get through,”
thought Coyote Pete to himself.</p>

<p>He refrained from mentioning his mistrustful
feeling to the others, however, as, after all, the
Mexicans might be honest enough folks even if
his impressions were otherwise.</p>

<p>After a wash-up in a small creek which flowed
at the back of the place, the adventurers were
quite ready to sit down to a smoking meal of
frijoles (beans fried with red peppers) and eggs
cooked in the Mexican style. Some thin red wine
was served with the meal, but as none of the
party had any use for alcoholic beverages in
any form, they were content to wash it down with
water from the great stone olla,&mdash;or water cooler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
which hung under the broad eaves of the veranda.</p>

<p>Jack had an uneasy sense that they were being
scrutinized as they ate, by some unseen pair of
eyes, and once looking up quickly he caught, or
thought he did, a glimpse of the woman’s print
gown slipping from a shuttered window. Jack
was not a boy to make a mountain out of a
mole hill, though, and concluded that, in all probability,
the woman, if she had been looking at
them, had been merely curious at the advent of
so many strangers.</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon, for it was late when
they concluded their meal, was passed in chatting
and lounging about under the trees. Nobody
felt inclined for more strenuous occupations. The
professor, however, having obtained some old
canvas, succeeded in fashioning a rough pair
of trousers. They were short and shapeless, and
his legs stuck out oddly from them like the drumsticks
of a fowl, but they were better than nothing,
he thought. As for the boys, they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
bought some baggy garments of the Mexican
type from the lone rancher, which would have
to last them till they reached the nearest town.
This, they were informed, was Santa Anita, and
was not more than ten miles distant.</p>

<p>An early start being determined on, they
sought their beds soon after supper, which consisted
of the same fare as the other meal with
the addition of some greasy pancakes. Jack ate
some of these, not caring for a second dose of the
peppery beans and a short time after felt, as
he expressed it to himself, “as if a cannon ball
were in his midst.”</p>

<p>Perhaps this accounts for his wakefulness, for
he found it impossible to sleep after they had all
turned in, in one large room,&mdash;or, rather, garret,&mdash;which
formed the second floor. The others
flung themselves on the straw, which served for
beds, with the lassitude of complete exhaustion,
but Jack lay awake, with the pancakes on his
chest like a leaden weight. At length he fell into
an uneasy slumber, from which he awakened a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
short time later with a start and a queer feeling
that something in which they were vitally interested
was going forward.</p>

<p>His first vague feelings rapidly crystallized
into more definite shape as, from the yard outside,
he could now distinctly hear the trampling
of horses’ hoofs. There seemed to be several
of them, to judge by the noise.</p>

<p>Moonlight was streaming into the garret
through an unglazed opening in the adobe wall,
and holding his watch in the rays, Jack saw that
it was half an hour after midnight.</p>

<p>“Queer time to receive visitors,” he thought
to himself.</p>

<p>At the same time he was conscious of an overwhelming
curiosity to ascertain who and what
the midnight arrivals could be. The boy had
noticed a door in the wall of the garret when
they first entered it that evening, and from his
previous inspection of the exterior of the house
he had formed an idea that it opened upon the
top landing of an outside stairway. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
been conducted to the garret, however, by a ladder
leading from the room below.</p>

<p>As well as he could judge, the noise came from
the opposite side of the house to that on which
the door was situated, so there did not seem to
be much chance of detection in slipping out of
the door, down the outside stairway and, from
some point of vantage, seeing what all the racket
might portend. There was one possible difficulty
in the way, and that was that the door might be
locked. But it proved to be unlatched, and Jack,
swinging it open, after he had partially dressed,
found himself, as he had surmised he would, on
a landing or platform at the top of an outside
flight of stairs.</p>

<p>In his bare feet, for he had not paused to put
on shoes, he slipped as noiselessly as possible
down the stairway and presently found himself
in the yard. The moonlight cast black and white
patterns of the overhanging willows on the
ground, but a brief inspection convinced Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
that there was no human being astir but himself
on that side of the house.</p>

<p>As he reached the ground he could distinctly
hear the voice of the slatternly woman crying
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hush!” to the new arrivals.</p>

<p>The voices which had been loud at first were
instantly lowered, and he could hear the riders,
whoever they were, addressing quieting remarks
to their horses.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to see what all this means,
if it’s the last thing I do,” said Jack to himself,
and suiting the action to the word he glided
rapidly along in the shadow of the wall till he
reached the corner of the house. There was a
low outbuilding there, which might at one time
have been used as a pigstye. This was just
what Jack wanted. He placed both hands on the
top bar of the little enclosure outside the pen-like
erection, and the next instant had vaulted lightly
over and was inside the little shack. The boards
of which it was composed were interspersed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wide cracks, and applying his eye to one of these
the Border Boy commanded a fine view of the
moonlit yard at the end of the house.</p>

<p>As he had expected, it was full of riders, one
of whom was mounted on an animal which somehow
seemed familiar to the boy. He with difficulty
suppressed a cry of astonishment, as the next
instant the rider emerged into the moonlight, and
Jack saw that he was none other than Black
Ramon. The others, he now recognized as men
he had seen in the camp on that adventurous
morning following the delivery of the warning
letter.</p>

<p>But Jack had not much time to meditate on
all this, for he suddenly became aware that
Ramon was riding behind the cantle of his saddle,
and that lying across the saddle itself was
a human figure. A second later the boy made
out that it was the senseless form of a woman
that the outlaw chief was carrying before him.</p>

<p>Hardly had he made this discovery before the
woman and the man of the lone ranch came forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and lifted the inanimate form from the
back of the black horse of the Border scourge.
As they did so a mantilla of elaborate workmanship
which covered her face, fell from it, disclosing
her marble-like features, as pale as death.
Jack then saw that she was young and very beautiful.
As the girl was lifted by the lone rancheros,
her consciousness returned, and opening
her eyes she began to pour out a flood of Spanish.
Jack, like most boys bred along the border,
had a working knowledge of the language, and
it didn’t take him long to gather that she was
promising rich rewards, estates, anything to her
captors if they would release her and restore her
to her parents.</p>

<p>But Ramon’s rejoinder was a hoarse laugh.
He informed the girl that he meant to exact a
heavy ransom from her father for her freedom,
and that if it were not forthcoming he would
make her his own wife.</p>

<p>An astonishing change came over the girl at
these words. From a pleading, terror-stricken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
maiden, she became a fine figure of scorn. Drawing
herself up proudly, she exclaimed with blazing
eyes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I would die before such a thing happened.
My father will find you out and punish you like
the wicked men you are.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Don Alverado will never find Black
Ramon or see his daughter again if a hundred
thousand pesos are not forthcoming before the
end of the week,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>In speaking these last words Ramon had unconsciously
raised his voice, and the rancheros,
with faces full of alarm, stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Hush! for heaven’s sake not so loud!” the
woman exclaimed, “there are several Gringoes in
the house!”</p>

<p>Ramon’s face grew black.</p>

<p>“Gringoes!” he snarled, “what do you mean
by admitting the Yankee pigs when I have paid
you well for the use of your house?”</p>

<p>“But they are here only for the night and are
sound asleep,” protested the male ranchero. “Depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
on it, they will not interfere. They are
pressing on toward Santa Anita to-morrow at
dawn.”</p>

<p>“And then, too, they have a belt full of money,
Senor Ramon,” whined the woman, “there is no
reason why your excellent self should not have
it. We had that idea in our head when we consented
to let them stop here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s the reason you suddenly became
willing to let us stop,” thought Jack in his hiding
place.</p>

<p>But Ramon was now leaning forward with a
sudden expression of keen interest.</p>

<p>“These Gringoes, old woman,” he asked, “tell
me, are they three boys, a tough-looking, long-legged
man with a yellow moustache, and a spectacled
old man?”</p>

<p>“Si, senor,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Santa Maria,” exclaimed Ramon, “here is
good fortune. It is those Border Boys and their
companions delivered into our hands for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
plucking. You did well to let them stop here,
senora. They are all asleep, you say?”</p>

<p>“Si. It is but a few minutes ago that my man
crept up the ladder and peered into the garret
in which they are sleeping. They are all snoring
like the Yankee pigs they are.”</p>

<p>“Bueno. We will attend to them shortly,”
was the rejoinder; “but now to dispose of the
girl. Have you a room in which we can confine
her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the small room at the other end of
the house. It was formerly used as a wine room
and is without windows, except a small one at
the top for ventilation. It has a strong door,
too, for when we grew vines and made wine,
thieves used to visit us, ill fortune light upon
them.”</p>

<p>“That’s a queer sort of morality,” thought
Jack, “for if I ever saw or heard of a precious
band of rascals, these are surely they. That poor
senorita! We must devise some way of aiding
her to escape, but what can we do? I guess I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sneak back now while they are busy elsewhere
and wake up the others, for if I’m not mistaken
we are going to have a tough fight on our hands
before very many minutes.”</p>

<p>As Jack cautiously slipped back by the way
he had come, he saw the senorita being led away
into the house, proudly disdaining to parley further
with her captors.</p>

<p>“There’s a girl in a thousand,” thought Jack
to himself, “no hysterics or uproar about her.
We’ve just got to help her out of the clutches
of those ruffians.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">TRAPPED!</p>

<p>Cautiously awakening his companions one by
one, Jack told them of his adventures while in
the pig pen.</p>

<p>“The scoundrels!” exclaimed the professor, “we
must act at once.”</p>

<p>“Now hold your horses,” drawled Coyote Pete
in the easy tone he always adopted when danger
was near, “it ain’t our move yet. If I ain’t very
much mistaken we’ll have all the action we want
in a very short time, too. As a first step I’d
suggest we bar that door yonder,&mdash;the one that
Jack sneaked out of&mdash;I see it’s got a good big
latch on the inside. In that way we’ll head off
an attack frum thar, an’ we’ll only have the trap
door from below to look after.”</p>

<p>The heavy bar being noiselessly placed in its
hasps, Pete outlined his further plans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’ll figger we are asleep,” he said, “but it
ain’t likely they’ll jump us till they’ve sent someone
up to make sure. It’s our play then ter git
back on the straw and all snore as natural as
possible.”</p>

<p>“What then?” asked Walt Phelps in rather
an alarmed tone. “We’ve only got one rifle.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, consarn it,” grunted Pete, “wall,
we’ll hev ter do ther best we can an’&mdash;hush, hyar
comes the advance guard now!”</p>

<p>In the room below they could hear cautious
footsteps. Evidently Ramon had lost no time
in hatching out his plans.</p>

<p>“Lie down, everybody, and sham sleep as hard
as yer can,” ordered Pete in a low, tense whisper,
“our lives may depend on it.”</p>

<p>The order was obeyed none too soon, for before
many seconds had passed they could hear
the creaking of the ladder as someone mounted
it. Presently, from one half-closed eye, Jack perceived
a head poked upward through the trap in
the floor. By the light which streamed up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
below he saw that it was the cranium of the red-headed
man whom he was pretty sure was the
author of the warning message which had been
carried into their camp.</p>

<p>The man stood still as a statue for perhaps
five minutes. During the tense moments Jack’s
heart beat as if it would break through his ribs.
It was not fear, but intense excitement that
thrilled him. The moment was at hand when
they would be engaged in a desperate game
against terrible odds. What would be the result?</p>

<p>Having apparently satisfied himself that they
all slept soundly, the scout of the outlaws descended
once more, the ladder creaking under
his weight.</p>

<p>“It’s goin’ ter come in a few minutes, now,”
whispered Pete, rousing himself, “gimme the
rifle, Walt. How many cartridges is in it?”</p>

<p>“Five,” was the disheartening reply.</p>

<p>“An’ we ain’t got another one between us,”
moaned Pete. “Wall, it can’t be helped, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hawk said to ther chicken when he carried her
of, leavin’ her numerous family behind. Now,
I’m going ter git right by this here opening and
the first head that pokes through it gits a crack.
We’ll save the cartridges for an emergency.”</p>

<p>“An emergency!” exclaimed Ralph, thinking
that if ever there was an emergency the present
situation had already arrived at that stage.</p>

<p>They could now hear whispers below, and
worse still, the ominous click and slide of repeating
rifles being got in readiness for use.</p>

<p>“There’s some old furniture piled in that corner,”
exclaimed Jack suddenly, “couldn’t we use
it to block the trap with?”</p>

<p>“A good idea when the worst of it comes,”
assented Pete, “but we’ve got ter keep ther trap
open so as to disable as many as possible before
we have to come to close quarters.”</p>

<p>The next ten minutes,&mdash;for though it seemed
like the same number of hours, it was not in
reality any more,&mdash;was the most painful period
the boys ever recalled having put in. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
room below came furtive sounds, but they were
so soft and infrequent that it looked as if the
main body must have withdrawn further to discuss
the attack.</p>

<p>“Say, let’s rush them. I can’t stand this any
longer.”</p>

<p>It was Ralph who spoke, but Coyote laid a restraining
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Easy, lad, easy,” he admonished in a low
breath, almost in the lad’s ear, “it won’t be long
before they start tuning up for the performance,
and it ain’t goin’ ter be a funeral march for us
neither.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Pete “clubbed” their solitary rifle,
holding it by the barrel. At the same instant a
door beneath quietly opened and closed, and the
next minute the ladder creaked as a foot was
placed upon it.</p>

<p>“Up with you, Miguel,” they heard Ramon
whisper, “here’s the knife. Remember the money
belt is on the old man. Jose, you follow him
closely, and Migullo, you come after. That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
all it is safe to trust on the ladder at one time.
I myself will come later.”</p>

<p>“The cowardly greaser,” breathed Coyote,
with one of his increasingly frequent lapses into
plain English, “I guess he’ll feel less like climbing
than ever when he sees what’s going to happen
to the first arrival. It’s a good thing for
us they can’t come but one at a time. In that
way they’ll have no chance of rushing us.”</p>

<p>As he finished speaking the boys felt the peculiar
thrill that comes before the enactment of
some exciting deed. A black head poked itself
cautiously through the trap and as it did so
Coyote raised his rifle stock, swung it, and
brought it down with crushing force on the head
of the intruding wretch. He fell backward with
a crash, and landed in a heap in the room below.
Under ordinary circumstances, not one of the
Border Boys would have stood for such drastic
measures. But they knew that now it was their
life or the Mexican’s. Nevertheless they felt relieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
as they heard the fellow stagger to his
feet and begin cursing in picturesque Mexican.</p>

<p>“Diablo! The fiend himself is in those Gringoes,”
he raved, “I think they have broken every
bone in my body.”</p>

<p>“More fool you, for not being more cautious,”
growled Ramon, and then, raising his voice, he
shouted up in English:</p>

<p>“It will be of no use to you to resist. I have
a superior force and if you injure another of
my men when I do get you it will go hard with
you. Surrender and give me the money and no
harm will come to you with the exception of Jack
Merrill. I mean to deal with him as I choose.”</p>

<p>“When you get him, you dog,” shouted Coyote
Pete, “which won’t be yet or for a long time to
come,&mdash;ah! you would, would you!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the cow-puncher had projected
his head thoughtlessly over the edge of the trap
door. A bullet aimed to kill, which, however,
whizzed harmlessly by his ear, was the result.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
The missile sang through the air and buried itself
in one of the rafters.</p>

<p>“We’ll give you all you want of that directly,”
hailed Coyote Pete, essaying what is sometimes
called “a bluff,” “we have plenty of rifles and ammunition,
and we can use them, too, so bring on
your next man.”</p>

<p>“You shall smart for this, you Gringo pig,”
cried Ramon from below. Evidently the complete
failure of his first attack and Coyote’s bantering
tone had driven him beside himself with
fury.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m a smart fellow, anyhow,” chuckled
Coyote Pete, “come on. One cigar for every
head I crack. That’s the way they do it at the
county fair with the Jolly Nigger Dodger, and
I don’t know as you greasers have anything on
him.”</p>

<p>“Rush up and bring them down out of that!”
screamed Ramon furiously. But the sharp lesson
they had just had seemed to hold the Mexicans
in check. Evidently the Gringoes above were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
not to be trifled with. Ramon strode up and
down the room stamping and raging and biting
his nails. Altogether he was in a fit of black
Latin rage which is not so very different from the
tantrums we occasionally find in our own nurseries.</p>

<p>“Why not come up yourself, Ramon?” was
Coyote’s next thrust. “If your head is burning
with such blazing thoughts it must need ventilating.”</p>

<p>But the Mexican, wisely enough perhaps, did
not reply. Instead, he called down the men from
the ladder, seeing, in spite of his rage, that it
was useless to waste his followers in that fashion.</p>

<p>“We’d better bottle up the trap door now,” said
Pete, as the voices below became more inaudible.
“Get that old furniture, boys, and we’ll
make things snug.”</p>

<p>“Here’s an old table top that might fit over
the hole,” said Jack, bringing the article in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
question, “it’ll just fit too, and it’s solid mahogany.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing, boy. Now quickly bring all
the stuff you can to pile on it.”</p>

<p>“Say, there’s a pile of big stones over here
where the chimney goes through,” reported Ralph
presently, “how would those do for weights?”</p>

<p>“Fine. Bring them right along. Your Uncle
Dudley will pile them.”</p>

<p>One would have said from the cow-puncher’s
boisterous spirits that he was in perfect security
instead of a situation the danger of which he,
perhaps, more fully realized than any of his
companions, comparatively inexperienced as they
were.</p>

<p>One by one the lads carried the big stones over
and they were piled on the table top.</p>

<p>“That will do,” said Coyote at length, “they’ll
never get that up unless they use dynamite.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they’ll do now?” wondered
Jack as, the work over, they sat down about
the newly covered hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Try rushing that back door, most likely. Suppose
you take a peek out of the window. It gives
a view of the steps and it’s too small for the
varmint ter git through.”</p>

<p>The small aperture, mentioned before, was
quite high up in the wall, but, hoisted up by
Ralph and Walt, Jack was able to rest his elbows
on the sill and peer out. He did so cautiously,
which was just as well, for, as the astute cow-puncher
had surmised, the next attack must come
from the back door. So much was evidenced
by a view of the steps which were covered with
dark forms advancing stealthily.</p>

<p>“We’ll give ’em another surprise party,” announced
Pete when he had heard his young lieutenant’s
report. “Jack, take the rifle while I
guard the trap. There’s a chance they may try
to rush the two places at once. Aim through the
keyhole, and when you think it time to, let ’em
have it. Don’t be scared of hurting them. Remember
it’s our lives or theirs.”</p>

<p>Feeling a bit squeamish, but far too good a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
soldier to attempt to disobey orders, or even question
them, Jack did as he was directed. Placing
the muzzle of the rifle to the keyhole he waited
with beating heart the first signal that their enemies
had ascended the stairway and were actually
on the balcony outside the door.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. Presently there came
a scuffling, scratching sound without, as the Mexicans
fumbled about the door, evidently feeling
for a latch of some sort. With a hasty prayer
that he might not inflict a mortal wound, Jack
awaited the right moment, as he judged it, and
fired.</p>

<p>There was instantly a loud yell of pain from
without.</p>

<p>“Good for you, boy,” grunted old Pete grimly
“you brung him down.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE GRINGOES MOVE.</p>

<p>From without the door there now came shouts
of baffled rage. The Mexicans were finding out,
as their kind has done before, that a party of
brave Americans is more than a match for twice
their number in a fight. Moreover, thanks
mainly to Jack’s presence of mind in slipping out
of the house and performing scout work, our
party was strongly entrenched. The door was
stout, and the iron bar within solid. There was
no apparent way of forcing an entrance by battering
it down, for the landing was too small to
use a “ram” effectually.</p>

<p>“Hooray, we’ve got ’em beaten!” cried Ralph
thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>Coyote flashed a scornful eye on him.</p>

<p>“Beaten!” he scoffed, “we ain’t got ’em beaten
till we’re out of this place and miles on our way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Why, if they kain’t do anything else they kin
starve us out if they want to.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” assented Ralph sorrowfully, and
then with a violent twist of spirits, “I guess we’re
goners.”</p>

<p>“There, go galloping off the reservation agin,”
struck in Pete; “we ain’t goners yit by a long
shot, but we’ve got a powerful lot of work afore
us, as the government said when they tackled digging
that Panama Canal.”</p>

<p>All now became silent once more, or at least the
boys could hear nothing. Evidently the Mexicans
had withdrawn for a council of war.</p>

<p>“This time they’ll be in dead earnest,” opined
the cow-puncher, “so keep a smart eye open for
’em everywhere.”</p>

<p>Hanging breathlessly on the least sound, the
besieged party waited for the first sign of the
coming attack. It was a long time in making
itself manifest, and when it did, it was for a
moment puzzling enough. It came in the form
of a noise from above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Somebody’s on the roof!” exclaimed Pete.
“The foxy varmints! I wonder they didn’t think
of that before.”</p>

<p>The roof of the lonely rancho was flat, and
soon they could hear several footsteps on it as
their besiegers paced about.</p>

<p>“What are they going to do?” asked Ralph in
a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>“Not hard to guess,” rejoined the professor,
“cut a hole in it, I guess, and then they’ll have
us completely at their mercy.”</p>

<p>“If we let them,” said Jack, “but why not try
to escape by the trap, while they are busy on
the roof?”</p>

<p>“That might be a good idea if it warn’t likely
that they have the foot of the ladder guarded,
or most probably have taken it down,” said
Coyote Pete; “no, you’ll have to guess agin,
Jack. Think uv something new and original.”</p>

<p>“I might say try that door, but I guess that’s
guarded, too.”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell you what we’ll do,” exclaimed Jack suddenly,
struck with an inspiration, “we’ll try the
walls. There may be a secret passage or a concealed
window in them some place.”</p>

<p>The cow-puncher laughed.</p>

<p>“This ain’t a story book, son, and I never heard
of such things outside of one. Lady Gwendolens
in real life come out by the fire escape more often
than by the old secret passage or the haunted
wing.”</p>

<p>Undismayed, however, Jack set about his task.
He was in the midst of it, and had met with no
success,&mdash;not that he had seriously hoped for
any,&mdash;when a sudden sound pierced the darkened
garret.</p>

<p>The noise was that of axes cutting into the
roof.</p>

<p>As Jack listened a slight shudder ran through
him. From that point of vantage the outlaws
could shoot them down as they wished, and there
would not be much chance of using their four
remaining shots in return. By this time Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
had reached the spot by the big stone chimney
from which they had taken the stone used to
weight the table above the trap door.</p>

<p>With a rather vague idea of using some more
of the stones as weapons, he started pulling down
the remaining loose ones. He had been at this
work but a few minutes when he gave a sudden
cry of triumph.</p>

<p>“Look! Boys! Look here!” he cried,
amazedly.</p>

<p>They scurried to his side to find him pointing
into a black, yawning mouth, evidently intended
originally for a fireplace but left unfinished, as
the stones they had used now testified.</p>

<p>“It’s big enough to swallow a horse almost,”
cried Ralph.</p>

<p>“It’s big enough to save our lives, maybe,”
grunted Pete, “but maybe it’s only a blind lead,
and may come out nowhere. In that case a fellow
at the bottom of a well would be better off than
the chap in there, for ther’d be no way of gitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
out uv that chimney once you got in, and&mdash;Jumping
Jupiter! Come back, boy!”</p>

<p>But it was too late. While Coyote Pete had
been talking, Jack had slipped into the fireplace,
and clutching the rough sides of the chimney had
taken the daring drop.</p>

<p>The others listened above in breathless anxiety,
and then, to their infinite relief, a voice
trickled up to them from the depths.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, boys! Come on, but take it
easy, for I knocked all the skin off my shins in my
hurry.”</p>

<p>The blows on the roof were by this time becoming
louder, and they could distinctly hear the
sound of splintering wood as the axe blades cut
into it.</p>

<p>“They’ll hev pecked through that in ten minutes,
now,” said Pete, getting over to one side
of the fireplace, “come on, boys. Be on your
way.”</p>

<p>But the boys insisted on the professor going
first, now that they knew the drop was safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
enough. Not without misgivings, to which he
was too brave to give utterance. Professor Wintergreen,
scientist and writer, cast himself into
that black hole in the garret of the lonely
rancho. An instant later, after a prodigious
scraping and bumping, word came up that he,
too, was safe. Ralph and Walt came next, the
former softly humming:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I don’t know where I’m goin’, but I’m on my
way.”</p>

<p>Coyote Pete came last; and now we shall follow
the party, leaving the Mexicans still hacking
away at the roof. It is a trip worth taking,
too, for at the bottom of the chimney an astonishing
condition of things prevailed.</p>

<p>The smoke duct led not into a cellar or into
a blind hole, but instead, Jack, on alighting, had
found himself, soot covered and scratched and
torn, in a large open fireplace in a small room.
As he made his sensational entrance there was a
sudden sharp scream from a corner of the room
and a female figure clad in white sprang up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>For an instant a dreadful fear that he had
alighted in some sort of a trap flashed into Jack’s
mind. But the next instant he realized that the
alarmed girl was none other than the senorita,
and that the room into which he had fallen was
the one selected as her prison.</p>

<p>“Hush, senorita!” exclaimed the boy, as soon
as he had given the signal to his comrades above
that all was well, “do not fear me. I am not one
of your enemies but a friend, an American. My
companions are with me,&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;that is, they
will be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, senor!” cried the girl in English, “what a
dreadful fright you gave me. You&mdash;you, if you
will excuse me, you are so black. I suppose it’s
the soot in the chimney.”</p>

<p>Jack could hardly refrain from smiling, as,
for the first time, he bethought himself of the
alarming figure he must present.</p>

<p>“I’m not as black as I’m painted, senorita,
really, I’m not. Nor are these two new arrivals
chimney sweeps, but young American gentlemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>”
he added with a sweeping bow, as Walt
Phelps and Ralph popped out of the chimney.
“Allow me to present myself. I am Jack Merrill,
and these are my friends, Walt Phelps, of
New Mexico, and Ralph Stetson, of New York.
Not forgetting,” he added merrily, as the
professor straightened up from an instinctive
brushing of his clothes, “our instructor and&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;chaperone,
Professor Wintergreen, of
Stonefell College, and,” as the other member of
the party appeared, “Mister Peter de Peyster, of
the Merrill Ranch.”</p>

<p>“At your service, miss,” said Coyote Pete with
a low, sweeping bow and a deep flourish of his
sombrero, to which even in his fall he had clung.</p>

<p>“Oh, I feel safer now,” cried the girl delightedly,
“but,” and she clasped her hands, “<i>Madre
de Dios</i>, what I have passed through! I was
summoned to my garden this evening by a decoy
message, that one of the good sisters at the convent
wished to see me. I had hardly set foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
on the path when I was seized and carried
off!”</p>

<p>“The rest of your story we know, senorita,”
said Jack earnestly.</p>

<p>“You know it?” repeated the girl in an amazed
tone, “but, senor, I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“I will explain later,” said Jack, “at least, we
all hope to have the pleasure of doing so. I
may add that I overheard the ruffians, your captors,
discussing the matter while I was hiding in
a pig pen.”</p>

<p>The senorita’s large dark eyes grew larger
than ever at this. She began to think Jack a
very peculiar young person to come sliding down
chimneys into rooms and to choose to eavesdrop
on brigands from pig pens. But she made no
comment, and the talk at once turned to the subject
of escape.</p>

<p>The door of the room was of oak, barred and
bolted on the outside, and impregnable. But the
window, high up in the wall though it was,
appeared to be just about large enough to squeeze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
through, ample enough even for Coyote Pete,
who was the largest of the party.</p>

<p>“Reckon we can reach it by putting this chair
on that table yonder,” declared Pete, “but we’ll
have ter look slippy, for those chaps will be
through the roof before long, and when they
discover we’re gone and see the hole in the
chimney, they’ll guess the route we’ve taken.”</p>

<p>When the table had been dragged over under
the window and the chair placed upon it, Pete
clambered up and found that he could easily reach
the aperture.</p>

<p>“It’s all clear outside, too, and the corral isn’t
more than a few rods away,” he announced.
“Boys, if we have any sort of luck we may get
out of this and save the young lady. I’ll go first,
for it’s a longish drop to the ground. Those that
foller kin land on my shoulders.”</p>

<p>The next instant he raised his lithe, ranch-toughened
form and wriggled through the hole.
In a flash he was gone.</p>

<p>“Your turn next, senorita,” said Jack; “allow
me to assist you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The brave girl made no foolish hesitation about
obeying. With a graceful little leap she was on
the table and by Jack’s side. In a jiffy he had
assisted her through and she was caught by
Coyote Pete outside. Next came the professor;
following him, Walt and Ralph. As Walt
alighted, he was ordered to creep over to the
corral, keeping cautiously in the shadow of the
willows. Once in the corral he was to get all
their horses and a saddle for the senorita, if possible,
selecting any one from the two or three
hanging on the fence after the shiftless Mexican
fashion. Presently Jack joined him at the
risky work, having been the last to emerge from
the window.</p>

<p>They had got the last of their own horses and
had selected one for the senorita, when there
came a loud shout from behind them followed by
a volley of shots.</p>

<p>A dreadful fear shot into Jack’s heart. Had
they been discovered?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">SENORITA ALVERADO.</p>

<p>But the next minute, to their infinite relief,
they decided that it was only a false alarm. In
all probability, so Jack surmised, it signified that
the Mexicans had broken through the roof and
were firing a volley of shots into the garret to
terrify its supposed inmates. He could hardly
forbear a chuckle as he pictured the outlaws’
astonishment, when, tired of their attempts to
terrify, they should penetrate the garret and find
it empty of life.</p>

<p>“Providence willing, we’ll be far away by
then,” he thought to himself as, with a wave of
his arm, he signalled to the others crouching
in the shadows of the rancho, that all was
ready.</p>

<p>The senorita laughed at the idea of a side saddle,
when Jack apologetically indicated to her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
ordinary Mexican affair which had been the only
one they could raise.</p>

<p>“A girl born and brought up on a Mexican
hidalgo’s estancia can ride in any saddle, senor,”
she said, “more particularly to oblige such gallant
rescuers.”</p>

<p>Jack felt himself coloring under his minstrel-like
coating of soot as the girl spoke. The lad
was somewhat susceptible, and the dark eyes
of the senorita had made quite an impression
on him.</p>

<p>“The pleasure is all ours, senorita,” he said,
with a vague recollection of having seen that
phrase in print somewhere.</p>

<p>The young Mexican girl sat her saddle as
lightly as a bird on a bough, and the mount they
had selected for her,&mdash;“borrowing” one of the
outlaws’ animals for the purpose,&mdash;was a fine,
springy-stepping creature, full of life and action.</p>

<p>“I guess our best plan is to head for Don Alverado’s
estancia,” said Jack, as they crept as
noiselessly as possible forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, much caution was not
necessary, for the Mexicans in the rancho, confident
of having bottled up the Americans, were
making so much noise that the light amble of the
horses could not be heard above the roar. Their
chief danger lay in being seen.</p>

<p>This, however, was not so probable as might
be imagined. The corral was separated from
the house by quite a small plantation of willows
and cottonwoods, among whose branches the
moonlight filtered thinly. Once they had rounded
the corral they would be practically invisible.</p>

<p>The senorita informed them that it was ten
miles from there to Santa Anita, in the suburbs
of which her father lived. This, as we are aware,
Jack already knew, and the corral once rounded
their steeds were set at a lively gait.</p>

<p>“Are there any police in Santa Anita, senorita?”
asked the professor, as they rode rapidly
through the night, the well-fed horses, refreshed
by their rest, pacing strongly forward. The professor
was a great stickler for law and order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“No police, senor,” was the rejoinder, “but it
is the headquarters of the Mexican Rangers who
have charge of the district. My father is the
local magistrate and administrator, and has
charge of them.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope that he will set them on the
track of those ruffians,” said the man of science
severely, “Mexico should be known as a land of
law and order like the United States.”</p>

<p>“Yet I have heard that you occasionally have
train robbers and all sorts of terrible criminals
in the United States, senor.”</p>

<p>The senorita spoke gently, but like all of her
race, she was patriotic and a flash of fire was in
her eye as she spoke.</p>

<p>“But we try to get rid of them, senorita,” stammered
the scientist, somewhat taken aback at
this self-possessed young lady’s reply.</p>

<p>“And so do we, senor,” was the answer, which
caused Coyote Pete to chuckle, “but you see, they
won’t always wait to be caught.”</p>

<p>“You speak English charmingly, senorita,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>”
said the professor, in an endeavor to change the
subject and pay a compliment at the same time.</p>

<p>“That is to the credit of one of your American
colleges, senor. I was educated at Vassar University.”</p>

<p>The boys exchanged glances. So that explained
the senorita’s poise and self-possession,
which were far more those of an American girl
than of a languishing Spanish beauty.</p>

<p>“I must compliment Vassar,” said the professor,
bowing his angular form. But he had forgotten
that he was riding bareback and was not
the most accomplished of horsemen in any event.
His attempt at courtliness almost caused his
downfall, for, losing his balance, he would have
slipped from his gaunt steed if he had not grasped
it desperately by the wither lock with one hand
while his arm encircled its neck.</p>

<p>From this undignified position he was rescued
by Coyote Pete, who spurred swiftly to his side,&mdash;it
will be recalled that Coyote had saved his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
spurs out of the general loss of property&mdash;and
aided him to recover his balance.</p>

<p>They all had the grace to refrain from laughing,
although the temptation was a sore one.
The man of science, glancing suspiciously about
him, was unable to detect the shadow of a smile
on any of their faces, although the senorita did
find it necessary to lean over and adjust her stirrup
leather. When she looked up, however, her
face was quite demure.</p>

<p>From time to time, as they rode forward over
the level savannah, they glanced behind them.
But the intervals grew longer as the distance
between them and the Mexicans increased, and
there was still no sign of pursuit.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ve discovered our escape, all
right,” said Jack, “but don’t venture to chase us
toward the town.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, I reckon,” said Coyote Pete, “and
in any event, with our horses we could outdistance
them all with a mile start.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“All of them except that big black of Ramon’s,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” agreed Coyote, “I’d like
to know if there air any relatives of that animal
hangin’ around. I’d buy ’em if it bust me. You
don’t meet up with a bit of horseflesh like that
every day of your life.”</p>

<p>An hour later, without any incident worthy of
mention having occurred, they clattered through
the sleeping town of Santa Anita, and, as daylight
broke wanly, they found themselves outside
the white walls surrounding the princely hacienda
of the wealthy Don Alverado. But if the
town was asleep, all seemed to be awake here.
Lights could be seen flashing in the house which
stood on a small eminence some distance from
the outer walls.</p>

<p>As they neared the gate of the estate, it flew
open and a dozen horsemen, fully armed, dashed
out.</p>

<p>“Surrender, caballeros,” they cried in Mexican,
“or we shall kill you without mercy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold your horses,” hailed back Coyote Pete,
quite oblivious of the fact that, in all probability,
none of the horsemen understood that free and
easy form of English.</p>

<p>But to the boys’ surprise the cow-puncher’s
words were greeted with a shout of laughter
from the advancing ranks, and a fresh young
voice cried:</p>

<p>“Who are you,&mdash;for the love of Mike?”</p>

<p>“We are Americans who have brought back
the Senorita Alverado,” cried Pete, and was
going on, but his words were drowned in a ringing
cheer. The next minute explanations ensued.
It appeared that the party which had
sallied out at their approach was made up of
young American mining engineers, resident in
the neighborhood, who, on hearing of Don Alverado’s
loss, had at once formed themselves into
a posse.</p>

<p>They had been starting out on a hunt for the
abductors of the Don’s beautiful daughter when
they heard the advance of our party. Surmising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that it might be the outlaws returning to commit
further outrages, they had concealed themselves
and dashed out intent on capturing or
killing the disturbers of law and order.</p>

<p>Their enthusiasm over the news of Senorita
Isabella Alverado’s rescue knew no bounds.
Wheeling their horses they dashed off up the
broad drive leading to the house to inform the
Don,&mdash;who was anxiously pacing his library,&mdash;of
the good news. They were followed, at a more
sober gait, by the Border Boys and their party.</p>

<p>“My poor father! He must have known heavy
grief in the past few hours,” breathed the senorita,
as they approached the house. Jack was
struck by the unselfishness of the thought. Of
herself the senorita made no mention nor of all
that she had endured at the hands of the outlaws.
It was only of her father that she appeared
to think.</p>

<p>Don Alverado, a tall, dignified looking old
Spanish gentleman, with a gray goatee and aristocratically
pointed moustaches, stood on the steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of the porch as they came up. His daughter
threw herself from her mount as they drew close,
and rushing into her father’s arms, was held
there for a brief interval. After his first emotion
at recovering his daughter had subsided, Don
Alverado bade the servants take the Americans’
horses, and came forward, warmly thanking them
for their services. It made the boys feel rather
shamefaced to be thanked in such emotional fashion,
for the Don would insist on kissing each of
them, and by the time he got through his face
was almost as black as their own sooty countenances.</p>

<p>Then they entered the house where, after they
had enjoyed refreshing baths, a hasty breakfast,
but magnificent in its appointments, was served.
In the meantime, Senorita Alverado had slipped
upstairs and donned a clinging gown of black,
in the bosom of which flashed an immense
diamond. The boys gazed at the wearer of the
gem with more admiration than at the stone itself.
If Senorita Alverado had looked beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
in the lone rancho she appeared absolutely regal
now.</p>

<p>“I see you regarding that diamond with interest,
gentlemen,” said Don Alverado, “it has an
interesting history. It was the present to me
many years since of a man who had received it
from an Indian sheep herder. This man, according
to my friend, had found a wonderful cave
in some mountain that he called the Trembling
Mountain. My friend tried to get him to give
some detail, but the Indian declared that devils
lived in the mountain who would kill him if
they knew he had revealed the secret of their
dwelling place to the outside world; so that except
for the fact that there is the stone,&mdash;and you
can see for yourselves it is a beautiful one,&mdash;I
regret I can tell you no more details. But, even
as it is, the diamond is doubly interesting outside
of its intrinsic value on account of its history.”</p>

<p>As the professor made no mention of their
own peculiar interest in the legend of the
Trembling Mountain, Jack and the rest said nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
about it. But, perhaps, all their hearts beat
a little faster at this convincing proof that the
strange story of Mr. Stetson’s dead protege was
true.</p>

<p>But it had been a long night and the lads
could hardly keep their eyes open, even their
sense of politeness flagging under the leaden feeling
that had come into their eyelids. The Don
noted this, and at once suggested bed. It was
high time, too, as the early sun was already beginning
to light up the magnificent grounds about
the place, and the boys felt like regular night
owls.</p>

<p>Servants in gorgeous livery escorted each lad
to a bedroom furnished with the gloomy magnificence
characteristic of the Spanish race. But
not one of them noted his surroundings as, tumbling
into the deliciously cool, clean sheets and
sinking into the downy mattresses, they dropped
into slumber as profound as it was dreamless.</p>

<p class="pch">EL FIESTA.</p>

<p>It was evening before the party reassembled.
On arising each member of our party found,
neatly folded upon his bed, a complete outfit.
Investing themselves in which, they felt more
like human beings again. For this kindness the
Don would not hear of being paid.</p>

<p>“It is only a small part of my indebtedness to
you,” he declared.</p>

<p>After the evening meal that night, which the
boys vowed was a starlight breakfast, the Don
informed them that the next day being a Saint’s
Day and a holiday in the village, he had arranged
for a series of sports of the country and
a great fete. This was partly in recognition of
his gratitude at his daughter’s recovery.</p>

<p>“As you are all good horsemen, possibly you
may wish to participate,” went on the Don; “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
prizes will be worth competing for. In the lassoing
contest the prize will be a double-cinched
saddle of Cordovan leather, silver mounted. In
a novel game called Tilting the Ring, my daughter
has donated as first prize a pair of silver
spurs. The second prize in both events will be
bridles fitted with silver-mounted bits and appendages.
There will be other games, races and
so on, but these two contests are the most interesting.”</p>

<p>Of course, this set the boys all agog. Their
first rather bashful feelings at the sumptuousness
with which they were surrounded, vanished,
under the stimulus of discussion of the forthcoming
contests. They all, with the exception of
the professor, entered for the Tilting the Ring
contest, which will be described later, while Coyote
Pete and Walt Phelps put down their names
as contestants in the lassoing events. Besides
these, there were races and jumping contests, in
all of which the boys decided to compete.</p>

<p>The next morning dawned fair and still. Jack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
on opening the leaded sash of his window, gazed
with delight at the landscape below him. Softly
rolling hills spread far and near, dotted with
park-like groves of trees. Cattle could be seen
in the distance, and Jack guessed that they were
part of the herds controlled by Don Alverado.
At the foot of the hill upon which the hacienda
stood, lay the red roofs and white walls of the
village, with its cathedral towers rising above
the green vegetation which picturesquely was
intermingled with the dwellings. Blue smoke ascending
into the still air from the chimneys proclaimed
the fact that Santa Anita was astir early
on the day of the Don’s fete.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a merry meal, and the boys
gazed admiringly at the senorita, who looked
more beautiful than ever in a white morning
gown with a dewy rose stuck jauntily in her
black hair.</p>

<p>“Say, she looks like an old Spanish painting,
only more so,” observed Jack to Ralph, as, leaving
Walt and Pete to look after the stock and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
professor to examine the Don’s extensive library,
they sauntered off to view the preparations.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you are taking a lot of interest
in old Spanish paintings, my gallant youth,”
chuckled Ralph with a knowing look.</p>

<p>Jack reddened.</p>

<p>“The Don has a whole gallery full of them,”
he said, “and naturally I made comparisons.”</p>

<p>“With the advantage in favor of the living
type,” chuckled Ralph; “say, you’re as easy to
see through as a spy glass, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“See here, Ralph Stetson, you shut up or I’ll
soak you,” sputtered Jack, looking rather sheepish
over his companion’s raillery.</p>

<p>Ralph deemed it prudent to change the subject.</p>

<p>“They certainly do things in style here,” he
said, gazing in admiration at the scene of busy
preparation which was going forward on the level
fields at the base of the hill on which the hacienda
was situated. Jack agreed with him.
Already a big force of men was at work roping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
off a course for the sports, and decorating the
poles in the national colors.</p>

<p>At one end of the course several peons were
erecting a rather tall pole with a swing cross-bar
affixed to the top. From this cross-bar depended
a cord to which was attached a ring by
a snap contrivance. At the other end of the bar
hung a heavy bag filled with sawdust. This was
for the game of Tilt the Ring, as they were to
learn later. Each contestant was required to
pass a lance through the ring so skillfully as to
remove it from the snap bolt. If he did not succeed
it was obvious that the bag of sawdust
would swing around and deal him a blow before
he could get out of its reach.</p>

<p>“Looks like a bully game,” opined Jack, after
the two boys had asked some questions of an
English-speaking peon, “but what happens to
you if the sack hits you?”</p>

<p>“Maybe stick on. More maybe you fall off,”
grinned the man.</p>

<p>“Humph,” grunted Ralph, “I don’t know so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
much about that game. Looks pretty strenuous
to me.”</p>

<p>Soon after, they visited the stables where Coyote Pete
and Walt already were. Coyote had his
lariat out, stretching it and getting it supple and
ready for the afternoon’s test, for the sports were
to commence after the midday meal. Walt was
rubbing the knees of his horse with care. Firewater
and Petticoats,&mdash;for Ralph had given his
new pony the old name,&mdash;whinnied as Ralph and
Jack entered, and their glowing eyes and shiny
coats showed that they were in fine fettle. In a
stall by them stood the horse they had appropriated
from the outlaws. It was a fine beast, somewhat
heavy, perhaps, but strongly limbed and
sinewed.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet Ramon would give a lot to have that
horse back,” observed Jack, gazing at the beast
admiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes, considering that we chose him in the
dark and in such a hurry, I don’t think we made
a bad choice,” was Walt’s rejoinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys ate sparingly at noon day, despite
the variety and splendor of the dishes set before
them. They felt that they were the representatives
of America at the games, and that it would
not do to risk a tummy-ache or any other uncomfortable
feeling. Ralph, however, eyed the
various dishes longingly, having, as we know,
a fastidious appetite. But Jack’s whispered,
“You’re in training,” was enough to keep him
to the agreement they had made before luncheon.</p>

<p>“I will have your horses saddled for you and
brought round,” said the Don, after the conclusion
of the meal. He was preparing to give
the order to a servant when Jack interposed.</p>

<p>“Without meaning any discourtesy, Don Alverado,”
he said, “we would rather saddle up
Ourselves. You see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say no more, say no more. It shall be as
you wish,” said the Don, but it was plain to see
that he was rather nettled over the Americans’
independence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“You see,” Jack explained to his chums later,
as they wended their way to the stables, “the
lower orders of Mexicans have no love for Americans,
and they are capable of putting up any
tricks on us. I don’t say that they would, but
then again it’s best to be on the safe side.”</p>

<p>A chorus of assent greeted this. It did not
take long to saddle up, the necessary trappings
being among the gifts which Don Alverado had
insisted on showering on the saviors of his daughter.
The party had protested that they were well
able to pay their own way, but the Don would not
hear of it.</p>

<p>“We do not treat our guests thus, in Mexico,”
he said, “and you, of course, know that the hospitality
of the old dons of Spain was proverbial.”</p>

<p>The Americans made a fine-looking cavalcade
as they rode at an easy trot down to the field
where the contests were to be held. All wore
sombreros, held under the chin by a strap of rawhide.
Riding trousers of the loose, Mexican style,
red sashes and short jackets completed their attire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
It was in fact only by their clear, cleanlooking
skins and erect bearing that you could
have told they were not of the Spanish race.</p>

<p>A large crowd had already gathered when they
reached the “lists,” as the scene of the contests
might be called. People came in costly carriages
with great C-shaped springs, in humbler vehicles,
and in back-country burro carts. From the town
a great procession streamed out on foot, and
everywhere there were Caballeros dashing about
on fiery horses, riding with the reckless abandon
of the Mexican horseman.</p>

<p>“We’re up against a likely looking lot of
horsemen,” said Ralph, as they came in full view
of the gay scene.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to do our best,” said Jack simply,
“the more skilled our opponents are, the more
credit it will be to us to defeat them if we can.”</p>

<p>In a corral some distance off were the cattle
that were to be used in the lassoing contests. A
curious crowd was gathered about them expatiating
on their good points. All at once a band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
broke out into the Mexican national hymn as
the Don and his daughter, accompanied by a
party of guests, rode up to their seats in a small
stand, protected by a striped awning, placed immediately
opposite the tilting ring apparatus.</p>

<p>“Gee whillakers, it’s hard to believe that we’re
in the twentieth century, ain’t it?” asked Coyote
Pete, as he gazed about him.</p>

<p>“It’s like Don Quixote,” cried Ralph, quite
carried away by the shifting pictures of color
and life on the greensward about them.</p>

<p>“Donkey who?” inquired Coyote Pete, whose
reading in the classics had not been extensive.</p>

<p>“Oh, a certain old gentleman in Spain whose
specialty was going about rescuing beautiful
maidens and getting into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Wall, that seems to be us,” observed Pete
dryly. “But look, the Don is announcing the first
contest. It’s the race to the town and back agin,
carrying a letter to the city hall, or whatever they
call it, and returning with an answer. Whoever
makes the best time wins a fine horse blanket and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a silver-mounted quirt. Any of you boys in it?”</p>

<p>“No, I want to keep my mount fresh for the
tilting,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Same here,” announced the others.</p>

<p>They watched the contest with interest, however.
It was won by a small Mexican on a wiry
little animal who sped into the town and back
in seemingly incredible time. As soon as he could
escape from the congratulatory crowd, the wiry
little horse was spurred toward where our friends
stood in a group waiting for their contests to be
announced.</p>

<p>“For you I have the letter,” he said, as he
rode up and extended a bit of paper.</p>

<p>“A letter for us. Impossible!” exclaimed Jack.
“Who could have sent it?”</p>

<p>“It’s addressed ‘Senor Jack Merrill,’ sure
enough,” cried Ralph, “and the address is printed,
too.”</p>

<p>“Somebody trying to disguise his hand,” commented
Jack, taking the note. “Well, let’s see
what it is, any how.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The note was only folded and when opened
proved to contain but a few words, but those
words were fraught with meaning.</p>

<p>“<i>Be on the lookout to-day. You are in great
danger.</i>”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that!” exclaimed
Coyote Pete. “Is it a genuine warning,
I wonder, or jest a trick to keep us out of the
contests?”</p>

<p>“Hard to say,” rejoined Jack. “Where’s that
little Mexican who brought it?”</p>

<p>But the man on the wiry little horse had vanished
and a diligent search by the adventurers
failed to disclose him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">BY FAIR MEANS OR FOUL.</p>

<p>A bugle note cut short their search. It proclaimed
that the start of the tilting contest was
at hand. The boys, accordingly, rode up to the
stand where the senorita handed each of them
and the other contestants a sharply tipped lance
decorated with white, green and red, the national
colors.</p>

<p>They were then informed of the rules of the
contest, which were simple. Each contestant was
allowed twenty-five tries at the rings, and the
one gaining the greatest number of points was
to be the winner. A blow with the sawdust bag
was to count one point off. As the Don finished
announcing the rules, the Mexicans gave a yell
and a flourish of their lances and galloped off to
the starting point.</p>

<p>Jack, Ralph and Walt saluted with a wave of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
their hats and flourish of their lances, and then
headed off after them. Their little display of
gallantry caused quite a murmur of admiration
to run through the crowd. This was increased
to enthusiasm when it was seen how easily and
well they sat their active little horses.</p>

<p>“Diablo! Those Gringoes can ride!” exclaimed
more than one Mexican in evident amazement
that any American could sit on a horse at all.</p>

<p>At the starting line the lads dismounted, as
they did not wish to impose any more exertion
than was necessary upon their ponies. Leaning
their lances against the ropes of the course, they
gave themselves over to studying intently the
methods used by the tilters, some of whom were
old hands at the game, or so one would judge by
the confidence they displayed.</p>

<p>“By George, those fellows are doing magnificently,”
Jack had to admit, as one after another
the Mexican contestants dashed down the human-fringed
lane and neatly transfixed the ring without
bringing the heavy sack around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The next instant a roar proclaimed that one
victim had been struck, and peering down the
course the boys could see the one who had failed
galloping off, shaking his spear angrily, while
his hat hung all awry on his head from the force
of the blow the sack had dealt him.</p>

<p>But while everybody was still laughing at the
mishap, and addressing all kinds of jocular remarks
to the victim, Jack suddenly turned around
as he heard a peculiar noise behind him. He
was glad he had done so, for as he faced about
the figure of a Mexican slipped away in the
crowd. The fellow had been standing by the
group of lances assigned to the Americans. With
a few quick steps Jack reached the implements
and found that an attempt had been made to saw
one of them through in the middle. The rascal
who had attempted the trick, however, had been
detected so quickly by Jack’s vigilance that he
had not had time to do much more than scratch
the tough ash handle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guess I’ll take charge of those lances,” said
Jack to himself, and he proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>The next minute Walt was summoned to take
his turn, and leaped into the saddle with a bound.
Jack handed him a lance, making no mention of
what he had discovered, for he had no wish to
make his chum nervous.</p>

<p>Down dropped the starter’s flag, and off dashed
Walt down the lane of faces, his mount going
like the wind. As he neared the post he crouched
and drove his lance, as he thought, straight for
the ring. But alas! he hit the arm of the tilting
apparatus and around came the sawdust bag,
hitting the Border Boy a blow on the head that
almost knocked him out of the saddle. A chorus
of yells and jeers that made Walt’s ears burn,
greeted his failure. He was much downcast, as
he rode back to the starting place to await his
turn to try again.</p>

<p>Ralph came next and fared no better than
Walt. But he was more easy-going about it.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll do better next time,” he shouted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the laughing Mexicans, none of whom understood
him.</p>

<p>Now came Jack. On account of his mount,&mdash;little
Firewater,&mdash;he perhaps attracted more attention
than the others. At all events, a great
ripple of sound swept like a wave through the
crowd as he dashed down the lists. But as the Border
Boy neared the ring and couched his lance for
the tilt, a sombrero was hurled from the crowd,
striking Firewater full in the eyes and causing
him to stop and swing with an abruptness that
would have sent a less practiced rider flying, and
perhaps have caused him serious injury. But if
this had been the intent of the man who hurled the
hat, it failed, for Jack kept his seat almost without
a perceptible shifting.</p>

<p>“A hundred pesos to the man who finds and
captures that scoundrel!” shouted the Don angrily.
“Senor Merrill, come here.”</p>

<p>Thus summoned to the stand, Jack became the
center of all eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc">Jack swept by in a cloud of dust and transfixed the ring.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was an outrage, senor, for which I
apologize to you in the name of my country,”
said the Don, his voice quivering with real
chagrin.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was cowardly!” cried the senorita,
clasping her hands impulsively.</p>

<p>“Most probably it was the act of some irresponsible
person,” declared Jack, unwilling to
give his host more pain.</p>

<p>“He shall suffer for it if he is caught,” was
the rejoinder; then turning to one of the officials
of the course, the Don told him to announce
that Jack would try again.</p>

<p>This time a roar of genuine surprise went up
as Jack swept by in a cloud of dust and transfixed
the ring as deftly as any of his predecessors.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried the Don, “and shame on any
of my countrymen who will not say likewise.”</p>

<p>This had its effect on those within hearing of
the Don, but on the outskirts of the crowd, where
the lower element of the town predominated, low
hootings and expressions of dissatisfaction were
heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>On the next round several of the Mexicans
failed, but Walt, Ralph and Jack each got one
of the rings. This placed Jack and the three
Mexicans who had succeeded on an even basis.</p>

<p>The crowd began to shout encouragement to
its representatives. One of them, a tall fellow
on a splendid horse, turned to Jack as they stood
awaiting their turns once more.</p>

<p>“A bet of twenty pesos on the Mexican team,
senor,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t bet,” rejoined Jack, “but I hope the
best man wins.”</p>

<p>The Mexican, with a glance of contempt, replied:</p>

<p>“Peste! You are only boys. Mocho chico.
What chance have you to win? You had better
withdraw before you are covered with shame
by your failure.”</p>

<p>“Guess we’re not worrying,” rejoined Jack
easily, “but it’s your turn, senor.”</p>

<p>“So it is. Behold, and you shall see with what
ease I will get zee ring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>He thundered confidently off. Alas, for the
caballero’s hopes! It is true that he “got it”
in one sense, but instead of getting the ring he
got the bag with a force that sent his sombrero
spinning into the crowd.</p>

<p>“Not so easy as it looks, eh?” laughed Jack,
as the discomfited Mexican came riding back
with a black frown on his face.</p>

<p>“Santa Maria, it was my horse’s fault,” he
declared, “the brute is no good. He is a beast;
what you Gringoes call a ‘skate.’”</p>

<p>He began spurring the animal savagely, making
the poor creature jump and caper about in its
agony.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that, senor,” said Jack quietly,
but with a gleam in his eyes. “By the way, we’ve
a proverb in our country that might interest
you.”</p>

<p>“A proverb,&mdash;bah! what is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, they say a bad workman always complains
of his tools,” rejoined Jack, looking the
other straight in the eye. “Think it over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the other could reply it was Jack’s turn
once more, Walt and Ralph both having scored
failures. Once more the Border Boy succeeded,
thus getting one point ahead of the rest. On the
next round, however, he missed the mark, while
the three Mexicans still in the contest all scored.</p>

<p>“You see,” said the tall Mexican, “we can
easily, if we will, prevent you Gringoes from
scoring at our national games.”</p>

<p>“By fair means?” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“By any means, senor,” was the reply, “all is
fair in love and war.”</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll keep an eye on you,” thought Jack
to himself.</p>

<p>With varying fortunes the game went on till
two rounds from the concluding one only Jack
and two Mexicans were left in the game. Walt
and Ralph had dropped out in favor of Jack when
they saw that they were too far behind to catch
up. The scores of all three, the Mexicans and
the Border Boy, were now even, and the excitement
was extreme. No cheers or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
sounds were to be heard now. In intense silence
the crowd watched every move.</p>

<p>The next bout found them still on even terms.
Now came the last, with everyone fraught up to
a tense pitch of excitement. It had ceased to be
a game of tilting the ring. It was a contest for
the supremacy of Mexico at one of her favorite
games.</p>

<p>“Now, Jack, old chap, no misses,” cried Ralph
from the crowd.</p>

<p>“Go in and win, old boy. You can do it!”
came from Walt.</p>

<p>Jack said nothing, but in his heart was a determination
to get that ring at any cost but that
of fair play. The tall Mexican now regarded
the Border Boy with open looks of enmity. He
made no attempt to conceal his hatred of the
young American boy who had made the best
horsemen in Sonora look to their laurels.</p>

<p>But Jack paid no attention to the fellow, concentrating
all his attention on his lance, to see
that it was in fit condition for the crucial test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The tall Mexican was the first of the trio to
dash off.</p>

<p>Yells, almost prayers, of encouragement implored
him to transfix the ring. But just as he
couched his lance his horse stumbled, and before
he could regain his stride the prize was gone so
far as that contestant was concerned. Next came
his compatriot. But ill fortune followed him,
too. In some unknown manner his aim, which
had proved unerring, now failed him at the test,
and he struck the ring with a jangling clink but
failed to dislodge it.</p>

<p>Bang! Around came the sand bag, knocking
him almost off his horse, which he had imprudently
reined up, in his chagrin.</p>

<p>Now came Jack’s turn. That lad would not
have been human if he had not felt a slight trace
of nervousness as he settled himself in his saddle
and prepared for the word. Amid a breathless
silence it came.</p>

<p>“Yip-ee-ee-ee!”</p>

<p>The cowboy yell broke from the throats of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Walt and Ralph. It was the only sound but the
clattering of Firewater’s hoofs as he rocketed
down the course. But the next instant Bedlam
broke loose as Jack’s lance entered the ring
cleanly and removed it from its snap without a
hitch. Howls and a few cheers filled the air, but
the former by far predominated. But amid the
confusion there came a sudden sound that
abruptly halted the babel.</p>

<p>Three shots sounded out sharp and clear. At
the same instant Jack, who had just reined in
Firewater, was seen to reel from his saddle and
fall apparently helpless to one side of it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">A BORDER BOY ERRANT.</p>

<p>But the bullets which had been meant to terminate
Jack’s career had not found their “billet.”
Instead, his sudden fall to one side of the saddle
was a quick acting out of an old cowboy trick.
The instant that the first bullet had whistled by
his ear Jack had flung himself down thus, and
as a consequence, the shots had missed their
mark. The relief of Walt and Ralph, as they
came elbowing through the crowd to find that
their chum was unhurt, may be imagined.</p>

<p>The incident, too, had quite changed the temper
of the crowd, as such things often will. An
unpopular monarch has often been turned into
his people’s idol by an attempted assassination,
and something of the same thing occurred now.
Cheers for the American boy rang through the
air. In the midst of the excitement Don Alverado<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
came riding up, pressing his big chestnut horse
through the throng.</p>

<p>“Thank the saints you are not injured, my gallant
boy,” he cried in his impulsive way. “Not
for my entire estates would I have had you even
scratched. But what is this?”</p>

<p>The Don broke off in his congratulations
abruptly, as a sudden commotion occurred on the
outskirts of the crowd. Rising in his stirrups
Jack could see that the center of the turmoil
was Coyote Pete, and that he was dragging
something at the end of his lariat, one end of
which was wound around his saddle horn.</p>

<p>Suddenly the crowd rushed in on this object,
whatever it was, but the next instant the wave
of humanity surged back again, as Coyote drew
two pistols and aimed them right and left into
the throng.</p>

<p>“The first one that touches the varmint gits a
taste of these!” he was shouting, and although
few in the crowd could understand the words,
they all caught the significance of his tones and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
fell back. Thus, left with a free path, Coyote
spurred his horse on and rode up to where the
Don and the Border Boys were assembled. The
professor had, by this time, joined the group and
brought word that Senorita Alverado wished to
be informed at once of Jack’s condition, and if
he had been seriously injured. Word was at once
despatched to her that he was unharmed.</p>

<p>What Coyote Pete had at the end of his lariat
was now at once apparent. It was a human being
who struggled to his feet as the cow-puncher
drew rein. Covered with dust as the man was,
and bleeding from his not over gentle treatment
by the first of the crowd who had rushed in on
him, Jack yet had no difficulty in recognizing the
man as the tall Mexican who had been defeated,
and who had declared his intention of shutting
out the American boy by fair means or foul.</p>

<p>“What is this?” demanded the Don, as the
abject object stood cringing and whining before
him.</p>

<p>“This is the pesky critter that fired them shots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
at Jack Merrill, your Donship!” announced Coyote.
“Stand up thar, you dirty dog, and let ’em
git a good look at you. Yer see,” he went on,
“arter that hat was thrown at Jack, I was on
the lookout fer dirty work, so I jest took up my
stand near the tilting post, fer I judged thet if
thar was truble it ’ud come thar. Wall, I seen
this fellow miss and ther look on his face when
he realized it. ‘Ole hoss,’ thinks I, ‘I’ll jes’ watch
you close.’ Wall, I did, but afore I could stop
him he fired them shots. Arter that he sneaked
off in the crowd, but I got arter him with my
lariat, and I reckon I got him good an’ tight
and hog-tied for branding.”</p>

<p>The Don’s face grew black.</p>

<p>“I know this fellow,” he said, “he is a former
employee of mine whom I discharged for quarreling
and gambling. But this outrage will terminate
his career. As a magistrate of this district,
I convene court here and sentence him
to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But with a piercing scream the abject being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
whom Coyote had lassoed cast himself on the
ground. He writhed, he dug at the dirt with
his nails, he grovelled and begged in an agony of
terror. But the Don was unmoved. It was different
with Jack, however. While the fellow’s
cowardice disgusted him, at the same time he
felt a faint sentiment of pity. At any rate, he
did not wish human life taken on his account.</p>

<p>Just then a woman rushed through the crowd
holding a child by each hand. Word flew around
that it was the would-be assassin’s wife and children.
This decided Jack. Pressing his pony forward,
he rode to Don Alverado’s side.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, sir, that leniency might be
observed in this case?” he said. “The man’s
wife and children, the excitement, the chagrin of
losing the contest, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say no more; say no more,” was the abrupt
reply. In fact, at the sight of the man’s terrified
wife and bewildered children, the Don himself
had experienced a feeling of compunction, “Jose,
your life is saved&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>The abject creature sprang up, pouring out a
fulsome stream of thanks and blessings. But
the Don abruptly checked him.</p>

<p>“Had it not been for your wife and children,
and for the noble intercession of this young man
whom you attempted foully to assassinate, I
should have hanged you without loss of time. But
their pleadings have had weight with me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, the blessings of the saints on the caballero’s
head,&mdash;&mdash;” began the Mexican, but once
more he was cut short.</p>

<p>“But I only remit your sentence on one condition,”
went on the Don, “and that is that you
leave this part of the country forever. My overseer
will supply you with the money. If within
twelve hours you are in the neighborhood of
Santa Anita, your life shall pay the penalty. Now
go!”</p>

<p>The Mexican reeled to his feet, and, shunned
by the crowd, tottered off. Only his wife and
children clung to him.</p>

<p>“Strange that often the worst of men will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
have the most faithful wives and devoted children,”
mused the Don. “But come,” he said,
putting aside his momentary gravity, “do not let
us mar the day by this incident. Senor Merrill,
you will now proceed to the stand where your
prize awaits you.”</p>

<p>At this the crowd set up a great cheer, and
surrounded by his friends, Jack rode to the
grandstand where the senorita, still pale, but
radiant, presented him with the prize. Jack,
crimson to the roots of his hair, stammered out
something in reply, he never knew what; and
then bending low he presented the lance tip on
which the ring still reposed to the senorita. With
a blush and a smile she took the ring and snatching
a red rose from her hair affixed it to the
point of his lance. What a shout went up then!
And in the midst of it our party rode off, for the
roping contest had been called.</p>

<p>“Say, where did you learn that trick, all that
bowing and doo-dadds, and all that?” grinned
Walt, as the chums rode side by side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, old chap, you acted like a regular knight
errant. Polite as a floor walker,” chortled Ralph;
“there’s only one thing you’ve forgotten to do.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Jack innocently.</p>

<p>“Why, press the rose to your lips, you chump.
I never read of any regular blown-in-panel knight
who didn’t do that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not one of that brand, I guess,”
laughed Jack. But just the same, it may be set
down here that he took particular care of that
rose for many a long day.</p>

<p>To his chagrin, Coyote Pete only came off second
best in the roping contest, but, as the boys
remarked, “It wouldn’t do for these people to
think we are hogs and want all the prizes.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Pete, good humoredly,
“an’, as somebody said, some place ‘thar’s glory
enough fer all.’”</p>

<p>Early the next day after participating in the
festivities of the evening, the lads and their
elders once more took to the trail. In the meantime,
the professor had attended to the renewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of their supplies and “scientific paraphernalia,”
and they had decided to confide their adventures
and the object of their quest to Don
Alverado.</p>

<p>“You are on an adventurous mission,” he commented,
“and I wish you all success.”</p>

<p>Before they set out the generous Don confided
to Jack’s care a document in Spanish.</p>

<p>“If you fall in with any government officials,”
he said, “that will act as your safeguard and
passport. Adios, señors.”</p>

<p>“Adios!” shouted the boys, as they rode off.
Jack, looking back in the early dawn, thought he
saw a handkerchief fluttering from an upper window
of the hacienda. At any rate, he waved his
sombrero gallantly and bowed low.</p>

<p>“Guess it’s a good thing we got Jack away
from the hacienda,” chortled Walt, in an audible
tone.</p>

<p>“Guess it’ll be a good thing for you to maintain
a discreet silence,” growled Jack, in what
was for him such a savage tone that Walt looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
rather alarmed. But before they had gone many
miles Jack, who had been silent and thoughtful,
began to become his old self once more under the
influence of the trail and looked-for adventure.</p>

<p>They traveled that day without any incident
worth chronicling, and nightfall found them
camped on a fertile plain, deep in waving grasses
and plentifully watered. The level expanse was
almost at the foot of the gloomy Chinipal Range,
in which was located the mysterious mountain in
search of which they had journeyed so far. That
night all lay down to rest with the feeling that
the morrow would see the beginning of their real
hard work.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TRAIL OF THE TREMBLING MOUNTAIN.</p>

<p>But the Trembling Mountain still lay far from
them. Following that bivouac at the foot of the
somber chain of mountains, they made their way
for some days through the most magnificent scenery
they had ever seen. Even Grizzly Pass could
show nothing to compare with it. It was an
enchanted land of soaring peaks, deep and narrow
canyons in whose depths lay perpetual twilight,
mighty cliffs and crags and leaping waterfalls.</p>

<p>Sometimes on topping an eminence they could
see far off to the southwest a circle of snowy
peaks vaunting it above their timber clothed
brethren. From some of these peaks issued columns
of blue smoke. Somewhere among those
smoldering volcanoes, the professor told them,
lay the object of their quest. At noon every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
careful observations were taken, but they still
pressed onward, the mystery and charm of their
quest increasing all the time.</p>

<p>Often, seated about the campfire, they discussed
the possibility of the Ramon gang having
trailed them; but the consensus of opinion was
that they had succeeded in throwing the rascals
off their tracks.</p>

<p>“But the scoundrels are keen on the scent where
gold or treasure is concerned,” said Ralph one
evening, “and I’ll bet that if they are not now
on our trail they are trying to get upon it. I’ve
got a private presentiment that we are not destined
to land that treasure without a struggle.”</p>

<p>“If only we could encounter those Mexican
Rangers of Colonel Alverado’s, our task would
be easier,” said Jack. “I’ve a good mind to look
about at daylight to-morrow before we get under
way, and see if I can discover some trace of
them.”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea,” assented the professor, “the
Don said that his men were off in this section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
somewhere, as it was suspected that the rascally
gang of which Ramon is the head would make in
this direction to seek shelter in the wild fastnesses.”</p>

<p>The next day, dawn had hardly made things
visible before Jack was stirring, and saddling
the big horse which they had taken from the
Mexican outlaws at the lone rancho, set forth
on his quest. They had wished to leave this
horse as a present to Don Alverado for his kindness,
but the Don would not hear of it. He
argued that they might need an extra horse, and
his words had proven true. The extra animal
had come in handy once or twice when one or
another of their own mounts was crippled temporarily
by the rough mountain roads.</p>

<p>Jack did not set out without an objective point.
This was the summit of a cliff at some distance
which he felt sure he could reach by a sort of
natural trail he had observed from below. It
was going to be risky, though. To begin with,
the trail was too narrow for him to turn back if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
he found it ended abruptly, but it was the only
way of reaching the cliff top, and Jack felt that
only from there could he obtain a good view
of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>To his relieved surprise, however, the trail,
though narrow enough in places to give a timid
rider heart failure, was yet wide enough toward
the summit to afford a foothold to a sure-footed
horse like the one he bestrode. After about half
an hour of breath-catching riding, the Border
Boy at length reached the top. As he had anticipated,
the view from there was as extended
as it was magnificent. Peak after peak in serried
ranks stretched away on every side. Deep canyons
lay between them, with here and there a
solitary eagle soaring above the dark depths. The
sky above was a blinding blue, and the newly
risen sun shone brightly, but yet, at that great
altitude, Jack felt chilled.</p>

<p>But if he had expected to see the smoke of
campfires, or spy a distant line of moving dots
on this vast panorama, he was mistaken. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
human note marred the impressive solemnity of
the scene. Jack Merrill, poised with his horse on
the cliff top, might have been the only being in
the world for any evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I’d better be getting back
again,” he thought to himself. “What a magnificent
country! It is like those cloud palaces you
see among the thunder heads on a still summer’s
day in New England.”</p>

<p>With half a sigh at leaving such a spectacle
behind him, the boy turned his horse, and as he
did so gave vent to a shout of surprise.</p>

<p>Kneeling on one knee behind a rock, and pointing
a rifle full at him, was the figure of a man who
must have crept quietly up while Jack had been
admiring the view. This figure made a gesture
cautioning Jack not to move, and then gave a
shrill whistle. Instantly the woods all about galvanized
into life. A score of wild-looking horsemen
sprang out. They were all armed, and Jack,
utterly at a loss to know what this could portend,
stopped short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, senors, what is it?” he asked politely.</p>

<p>“Get off that horse, Miguel de Acosta,” ordered
one of the men sternly. “It is useless to
resist, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But my name doesn’t happen to be Miguel de
Acosta,” protested Jack.</p>

<p>“In that case, what are you doing with his
horse?”</p>

<p>“Whose horse?”</p>

<p>“Why, De Acosta’s. If you are not De Acosta
and have his horse you are a horse thief, which
is as bad under our laws as any of the crimes of
which De Acosta is accused.”</p>

<p>“Will somebody please tell me what all this
means?” cried Jack, looking about him bewilderedly.</p>

<p>“Please let me examine the brand of that
horse,” said the first speaker, who seemed to be a
kind of leader; “ah, just as I thought. A bar
and a flying U. That’s De Acosta’s horse and
you are the man we’re after. Get off now.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;,” began Jack, beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
think that this adventure might turn out seriously
after all.</p>

<p>“No explanations now. You may make those
to the commandante later. Come, senor,” as
Jack still hesitated, “are you going to dismount?”</p>

<p>“Nothing for it I suppose but to obey,” said
Jack, clambering out of the saddle.</p>

<p>The man who was conducting this inquiry
while the rest looked grimly on, was excessively
polite, but there was something alarming in his
very suavity. As Jack’s feet touched the ground
a sharp order was given in Spanish, and two of
the horsemen who had so suddenly appeared
stepped to his side. As they did so they tapped
their rifles significantly. But suddenly Jack
noted something, and that was that on the butt
of each of the rifles was stamped Republica de
Mexico, No. 2, Sonora.</p>

<p>A great light broke upon him.</p>

<p>“Why, you are Mexican Rangers,&mdash;Rurales,&mdash;are
you not?” he demanded of the seeming leader.</p>

<p>“Si, senor. None should know that better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
you.” was the grave reply. “We are the second
division of Sonora, with headquarters at Santa
Anita.”</p>

<p>“Hooray, then it’s all right after all,” cried
the boy, and plunging his hand into his breast
pocket he drew forth the paper which Don Alverado
had given him before they departed from
his hospitable roof. The officer scanned it with
raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Why, senor. A thousand pardons. I see that
a mistake has been made. But pardon me, how
do you come to be riding the horse of the notorious
outlaw, De Acosta, who is one of Black
Ramon de Barros’s chief lieutenants?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see it all now,” cried Jack, “you were
in search of Black Ramon, and when you saw a
horse answering the description of De Acosta’s,
you at once jumped to the conclusion that I must
be he. Say, that’s quite a joke.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have been much of a joke for you,
if you had not proved your identity, senor,” was
the grave reply of the officer,&mdash;for such Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
now knew he must be, “do you know what we
would have done with the real Acosta had we
found him? Hanged him to the nearest tree and
left his body for the gallinazos and the buzzards.”</p>

<p>The day was warm, but Jack shuddered as the
leader of the Mexican Rangers spoke.</p>

<p>“But, senor,” went on the young officer, “you
hinted just now at having a story to tell about
how you came by the horse. Will you breakfast
with me at our camp yonder, and you can relate
your story as we eat? It may be of great value
to the State if it throws any light on the ways of
Black Ramon.”</p>

<p>Jack assented to this proposition. For one
thing, he was hungry. For another, he saw that
the Mexican Rangers might prove valuable allies
in case of a brush with the Ramon outfit. All
the rurales, among whom a very democratic
spirit prevailed, were much interested in his tale.
They hung closely about the officer’s quarters, a
blanket stretched on the ground, while Jack related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
his story of the happenings at the lonely
rancho. It made an odd scene, this conclave under
the great mountain pines. There was the
clean-cut American lad sitting tailor fashion
opposite the young officer who listened eagerly,
while all about hovered the forms of the rangers,
clad in bright sashes and brilliant-hued serapes,
with immense cone-topped hats lavishly decorated
with gold and silver braid. Jack learned
later that some of these men oftentimes pay as
high as two hundred dollars for their headgear,
and that a good sombrero will pass down from
father to son and grandson without deteriorating.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of Jack’s narrative, the officer
expressed a wish to visit the camp of the
Border Boys, more especially as it was in a part
of the mountains unfamiliar to him. No time,
therefore, was lost in mounting and getting under
way. The Rangers used bugle calls like regular
troops, the trumpeter riding at the leader’s side.</p>

<p>In single line they defiled down the steep trail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
by which Jack had ascended, and were soon at
the foot of the mighty cliff.</p>

<p>“And where is your camp, senor?” inquired
the officer, after they had ridden for some time
in the direction in which Jack knew it lay.</p>

<p>“That’s what’s puzzling me, senor,” rejoined
the boy anxiously, “it should be here, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly. Undoubtedly from the
litter and the still smoking embers upon which
they had just that minute stumbled they must be
at the site of the camp. But where were the lad’s
companions?</p>

<p>Had the earth swallowed them they could not
have vanished more completely, nor did a painstaking
search by the Rangers reveal any clue
as to their whereabouts or the manner of their
departure.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">BLACK RAMON’S TRICKERY.</p>

<p>“This looks like some of that rascal Ramon’s
work!”</p>

<p>Jack paused in the fruitless search and wiped
the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>The officer of the Rangers, whose name was
Antonio Del Rio, carefully rolled a brown paper
cigarette and lighted it before he glanced up at
the troubled young countenance before him.</p>

<p>“I think you are right, senor. During your
absence he and his band must have surprised the
camp and carried your amigos off as prisoners,
that is, unless they themselves have taken to the
trail.”</p>

<p>“And leave me behind! Not likely. No, senor,
they have met with some foul play.”</p>

<p>“I proffer you my services and those of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Rangers,” was the prompt rejoinder, “we will
set out at once.”</p>

<p>“But the question is, in which direction shall
we go?” asked Jack, frankly bewildered.</p>

<p>“Wait. I will call Juan Andreas. He is the
most expert tracker in the Rurales, and if there
is a chance of picking up their trail, he will do
it.”</p>

<p>Andreas proved to be a small, shrivelled Mexican
on a “paint” or spotted pony. Jack saw that
his eyes flashed like those of an old hunting dog,
as, in obedience to his superior’s command, he
slipped from his pony and began running about
in the surrounding woods, crouching low, with
his nose almost on the ground.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped, straightened up, and with
a gesture almost regal, he raised a hand and
pointed to the west.</p>

<p>“They go that way,” he said in Mexican.</p>

<p>The young officer nodded. The notes of the
bugle rang out, and an instant later the camp
site was once more deserted as the cavalcade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
dashed off through the dense woods in hot pursuit
of the missing men and boys.</p>

<p>It is now time that we inquire for ourselves
just what was happening and had happened to
Ralph, Walt, Coyote Pete and the professor.
After Jack had left the camp then, the professor
with his geological hammer had started out to
get specimens, of which he already had several
pounds, much to Coyote Pete’s disgust.</p>

<p>He wandered down the canyon and had perhaps
gone further than he intended, when suddenly he
was seized from behind, his arms pinioned and
the cold muzzle of a pistol pressed to the back of
his neck.</p>

<p>“Now march,” came a crisp order, and the man
of science, being also a man of discernment,
“marched.” He did not dare to turn his head,
but from the trampling of hoofs behind him he
judged that several men must be following in
his wake. Before long he found that they were
undoubtedly headed for the Border Boys’ camp.
But he dared make no outcry, for the old man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
had guessed already that his captors must be
Black Ramon’s men, and he knew that they held
human life no dearer than so much dust.</p>

<p>Arrived near to the camp, the old man was
tied to a tree and gagged, and then his captors,
whom he now recognized as Ramon’s band, scattered
among the trees in such a manner that they
completely encircled the camp. All at once one
of them began to make a peculiar sound,&mdash;a perfect
imitation of the “gur-gur-gur-gobble” of the
wild turkey.</p>

<p>How the professor longed to warn the boys of
the crafty trap that was being set for them! But
he was powerless to do anything. As the wily
band of marauders had guessed, the “skirling”
of the supposed turkey was enough to set the
camp agog. Snatching up shotguns, Walt and
Ralph plunged off into the underbrush. They
had not gone twenty paces before the brigands,
noiselessly as panthers, seized and bound them,
old coats being held over their heads to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
their making any outcry. This done, they were
bound to the same tree as the professor.</p>

<p>The capture of Coyote Pete alone, now remained
to be accomplished. For, as we know,
though the marauders were not aware of the fact,
Jack was far from the camp at the time. But
in Coyote the Mexicans caught a Tartar. The
old plainsman was frying some bacon, stooping
low over the coals, when the sharp crack of a
twig behind him caught his attentive ear. Like
a flash he bounded erect, but not before the muzzles
of a dozen rifles were aimed at him from the
underbrush.</p>

<p>Black Ramon was taking no chances with Coyote
Pete, whom he knew both by reputation and
experience.</p>

<p>For one instant, as he took in the situation,
Coyote was still as a figure carved from marble.
Only the heaving of his chest under his
blue shirt showed that he was, for him, considerably
startled.</p>

<p>Suddenly, and without the slightest warning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the old plainsman crouched low, and then dashing
straight at the nearest Mexican, seized him by
the legs, and before the others had recovered
their senses, he had hurled the fellow backward
by an expert wrestling trick. The astonished
Mexican alighted in the midst of the campfire,
overturning the spider, from which he was plentifully
sprinkled with scalding bacon fat.</p>

<p>In this way Coyote, cut off from reaching his
own weapons, managed to possess himself of a
rifle.</p>

<p>“Now,” he shouted, “the first varmint that
fires at me gets some of this lead. I may only
have one shot, but I’ll make that one tell.”</p>

<p>A storm of bullets was the result, but Coyote
with that quick foresight which was his characteristic,
threw himself flat behind a large rock, with
the result that the leaden hail spattered against
the solid stone.</p>

<p>Suddenly a figure on a black horse rode into the
little clearing. It was Ramon himself. Without
the slightest hesitation Coyote threw up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
rifle to his shoulder, and, disregarding his own
danger, fired point blank at the outlaw leader.</p>

<p>But for once Coyote Pete’s aim was at fault.
Ramon was not even scratched by the missile.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” exclaimed Pete, “I begin ter think
thar is suthin’ in that story that he bears a
charmed life arter all. I had a plum bead on him
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>In his astonishment at his missing such an
easy shot, the cow-puncher had not noticed several
forms creeping through the dark woods behind
him. Before he had a chance to defend
himself, he was dealt a mighty blow on the back
of the head by a “clubbed” rifle in the hands of
one of the outlaws whose head was encircled by a
big bandage.</p>

<p>“Take that for the blow you struck me at the
rancho,” grunted the fellow, as Pete, spreading
his arms, fell forward like a stunned ox. The
man who had dealt the blow was the same whom
Pete had knocked off the ladder on that memorable
night at the lonely rancho.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pick him up and place him with the others,”
ordered Ramon, without the slightest trace of
any emotion whatever showing on his copper-colored
face.</p>

<p>This order was swiftly carried out, and the
consternation of the others may be imagined
when they saw the cow-puncher’s lanky form
being carried by two of the raiders. They had
heard the shots and at first they feared that Pete
was dead, but to their relief, the next minute, they
overheard Ramon remark:</p>

<p>“Throw him upon his horse when you bring it
up. He’ll be all right in a short time.”</p>

<p>Presently the boys, with eyes that flamed with
indignation, saw the Mexicans leading up their
stock, not forgetting the pack burros, whose burdens
had been hastily hitched on.</p>

<p>“Caramba, but I would like to lay my hands
on that other one, that Merrill boy, more than
all the rest,” snarled Ramon through his yellow
teeth. “Take the gag out of that boy’s mouth
yonder, and ask him where Jack Merrill is,” commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Ramon of one of his men, none other in
fact than the Acosta for whom Jack had been
mistaken.</p>

<p>Ralph was the prisoner designated by Ramon,
and not a little relieved was he to have the not-over
clean bit of cloth, with which his mouth had
been stopped, removed from his teeth.</p>

<p>“Now then,” blustered Ramon, “where is Jack
Merrill?”</p>

<p>“Far from here and on a mission to Santa
Anita,” retorted Ralph boldly. He was an honest
lad, but in such a case deceit was the only
course possible. If he had told the truth, the
bandits were quite capable of hiding and waiting
for the boy, thus enmeshing the whole party.</p>

<p>“What has he gone there for? Be careful,
boy, and speak the truth.”</p>

<p>“To get the Mexican Rangers to run down all
such rascals as you,” was the bold reply, and one
which an instant later Ralph wished he had bitten
out his tongue before he made.</p>

<p>“Well, that being the case, forewarned is forearmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
as you say in your country,” rejoined Ramon.
Then in Spanish he gave orders to mount
immediately. First, however, he presented Jack’s
pony Firewater to Acosta, as a recompense, presumably,
for the loss of the latter’s own animal.</p>

<p>The boys and the professor were hustled into
saddles and their legs tied together under the
ponies’ bellies. Ramon stood by looking on sardonically
while this was being done.</p>

<p>“You are not at the lone rancho now,” he
chuckled, “but in the heart of the most lonesome
range of mountains in Mexico. That was a
clever trick of yours to escape with the senorita,
but now you are going to pay for it. Ah, yes, I
shall have a revenge, and such a revenge it will
be, too!” He showed his long yellow fangs as
he spoke, and chuckled hideously. In spite of
their determination to be calm, the lads shuddered
a bit. But the professor stared stonily at the
ruffian.</p>

<p>“Am I to understand that it is your intention
to abduct us?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is,” was the rejoinder, “I mean to make
you useful to me in many ways. As my slaves
in Trembling Mountain I’ll make you wish every
hour of the day that you had never tried to thwart
Black Ramon. Forward!”</p>

<p>At the command the band dashed off. Coyote
Pete, still unconscious, tied to the saddle of his
horse. The boys’ gags had been removed, as had
the professor’s of course, and as the rush of
hoofs drowned other sounds, Walt found an opportunity
to say to Ralph:</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, old Jack’s still at large. Depend
upon it, he’ll find some way to get the
Mexican Rangers and help us out of this.”</p>

<p>But Ralph shook his head.</p>

<p>“We’re at the last ditch now, Walt,” he replied.
“I don’t see a chance for us.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">WHAT COYOTE DID.</p>

<p>Coyote Pete, as Ramon had prophesied, came
out of his swoon before long. His return to consciousness
was enlivened by some of the most
picturesque language the Mexicans had ever
heard. But as Coyote had been tied to the saddle
he could not relieve his mind otherwise than
by using all the opprobrious names he could select
from a copious vocabulary. Now it was a
peculiarity of Pete’s that he never swore,&mdash;that
is, actually used bad language,&mdash;but he had invented
a language all his own to express his feelings
when angry. Set down on paper it would
look tame, but as Coyote Pete used it, it was
tremendous,&mdash;exterminating almost.</p>

<p>But after his first outbreak, Coyote remained
unusually calm. He was thinking with all his
might, but all his thinking did not bring him any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
nearer to a solution of their difficulties. They
were in the hands of the most bloodthirsty band
of rascals in Mexico. Even if they escaped, they
would be bound to perish miserably in those rugged
wilds without food or the weapons to procure
any. The nearest settlement, Pete knew, must
be at least two hundred miles away, and probably
more.</p>

<p>Truly, it was not a cheerful predicament. In
fact, as Ralph had said, it looked very much like
the last ditch. But Coyote was not of the kind
of human that gives in and throws up its hands
just because on the surface of things it seems
time to abandon hope. Far otherwise, as the
readers of other volumes of this series know.
There probably was not a cooler head nor a better
one along the border than Coyote Pete, but
even he had to own that, for the present anyhow,
he was “stumped.”</p>

<p>At noon a halt was made for a few minutes,
and frijoles, corn bread and muddy black coffee
(cold) was given the prisoners. The professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
could not eat, he was in such a state of mind.
But the others fell to heartily enough; the boys,
because they were boys, with appetites that nothing
could upset, and Coyote Pete, with the idea
of “firing up” with nourishment in case he might
find some way out of it for all of them.</p>

<p>All the afternoon they traveled, reaching
higher and higher altitudes. Every now and
again Ramon would consult earnestly with the
red-haired outlaw of unmistakably American
origin, who had, as Jack felt certain, left the
warning notes on two occasions,&mdash;once at the
camp in the canyon, and again at Don Alverado’s
fete. But on the latter occasion, unless it was
one of the band that hurled the sombrero at Firewater’s
head, the outlaw’s plans did not seem to
have materialized.</p>

<p>But if this man was friendly to the boys he
did not give any sign of it. Instead he glared
at them as malevolently as did any of the others.</p>

<p>“You’re the kind of American that looks best
decorating a tree,” thought Pete, who was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
allowed to sit erect on his pony, although, like the
boys and the professor, his feet were tied underneath.</p>

<p>On and on they traveled throughout the afternoon,
Ramon urging his followers up to a terrific
pace considering, that is, the nature of the country
they were traversing. Now they would
plunge down into dark and gloomy defiles where
perpetual purple twilight reigned, and again on
mounting some crest they would see, spread out
before them, a panorama of much the same sort
as had so delighted Jack on the cliff summit before
he fell in with the Mexican Rangers.</p>

<p>“If I don’t miss my guess,” said Pete, when
he found a chance to exchange a word with the
boys, “we are getting into the Trembling Mountain
country. See that big peak over thar? It’s
smokin’ away like old man Jones with his corn
cob evenin’s.”</p>

<p>This was a fact. The smoking mountains,
smoldering volcanoes that the boys had observed
in the distance on their trip into this wild country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
were in fact getting closer. And splendid
sights they were, too. Some of them shot up
into the blue sky to a height of fully seventeen
thousand feet. The walls of the canyons they
began to traverse now were different, too, from
those they had left behind them. Instead of
being composed of dull gray or slate colored
rocks, these great rifts flamed with red and
yellow strata, intermingled with gorgeous bands
of purple and sometimes wavy strata of green.
Evidently the internal fires of the earth had been
busy here in the youth of the globe.</p>

<p>Occasionally, boiling springs sending up jets of
sulphurous-smelling steam and bordered by brilliant
green plants, were encountered. It was the
most impressive country the boys had ever traveled
through, and had a few fiends, all dressed
in red, with hoofs, horns and tails complete, suddenly
appeared from behind a mass of rocks,
they would hardly have been surprised. The
place seemed a fitting setting for an Inferno.</p>

<p>By dusk they were on a sort of plateau at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
mouth of one of these mountain canyons. Trees
and rocks of normal shapes and hues stood about
in almost park-like fashion. Wild oats and plenty
of bunch grass offered good and abundant feed
for the horses, and from a cliff side of this little
oasis in that land of gloomy horrors bubbled a
crystal spring of cold water.</p>

<p>No wonder Ramon, with his countrymen’s instinct
for selecting good camp sites, elected to
halt there. As for the boys, even in their predicament,
they could not help admiring the soft intimate
character of the scenery, coming, as it did,
after their experiences in the gloomy abysses
and profundities behind them.</p>

<p>The prisoners were taken from their horses
and then carefully rebound, although so stiff
were their limbs from their long confinement that
it is doubtful if they could have run just then,
even had they found an opportunity. Supper
was the same rough meal as the midday refection
had been. To add to the unpalatable nature of
the food, the boys had the doubtful pleasure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
watching Ramon and his followers dine sumptuously
on the contents of the Border Boys’ packs.</p>

<p>As night fell sentries were posted about the
camp, and the prisoners could not but admire the
caution which led Ramon, although in a presumably
uninhabited part of the country, to post his
outguards as carefully as if an immediate attack
was to be expected. One by one the outlaws
threw themselves on their blankets and were soon
wrapped in that heavy slumber characteristic of
the hardy dwellers of the open places. Only Ramon
did not sleep. For hours he strode up and
down in front of the fire with his head sunk on
his breast. He seemed lost in thought. Once or
twice he paused and seemed to listen intently.
Was it possible that with his half-wild instinct
he sensed the peril that was even then drawing
in upon him through the night?</p>

<p>At last, however, even he sank off into slumber,
and then, with the exception of an armed
outlaw posted to guard the captives, the camp was
enveloped in dense silence. The guard hummed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
softly to himself some old Spanish riding songs
as he sat by the blaze, the firelight playing on his
almost black features.</p>

<p>There was some tall grass at the back of the
spot in which the boys and their elders had
spread themselves out to snatch uneasy slumbers,
and before long Pete’s quick ear detected a stirring
in it. Suddenly a voice spoke softly:</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word or appear surprised, I’m
going to help you out, just because I’m a Yankee
myself and I know Ramon means to kill you all
when he gets a chance.”</p>

<p>Coyote kept a hold on himself, and hardly moving
his lips, rejoined in the same cautious tones:</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter,” replied the other, who
was the man we know as Canfield, the former
friend of Ruggles the miner, “it’s enough to say
that I was once decent, back north; but that’s long
ago, and no use crying over it. Look out, I’m
going to cut you loose.”</p>

<p>As the words were spoken, Coyote felt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
unseen Samaritan slash his bonds, but the cow-puncher
prudently did not at once draw his hands
from behind his back. Instead, he darted a furtive
look about. The sentry, crooning by the fire,
seemed to be half asleep. Doubtless he didn’t see
much sense in giving too vigilant a watch to such
helpless prisoners.</p>

<p>“I tried to keep you out of this, you know,”
came the voice again; “I got one note to you and
got shot for my pains. Then again at Don Alverado’s
fete I despatched another one. It was
Ramon’s intention to shoot Jack Merrill that day,
but the vengeful Mexican, Jose, took the task
out of his hands.”</p>

<p>“Was Ramon in the crowd?” gasped Coyote in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes. But he is as skillful in disguise as he is
in most other things. He was disguised as an old
peddler of sweetmeats. But in his basket he had
hidden a carbine, which if he had ever used it,
would have put that young Merrill out of the way
forever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“Great bob cats! he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But a sudden rustling in the grass behind him
apprised Coyote at that juncture that he was
alone. With another quick glance about he set
to work on his leg-thongs. So intent was he
on his work that perhaps he relaxed his vigilance
a trifle, for when he looked up, directed by some
strange instinct to do so, it was to see the form
of Ramon standing over him with a revolver
pointed grimly at the cow-puncher’s head.</p>

<p>In this terrible emergency Pete’s mind was
made up in a flash. With one quick slash he finished
freeing himself, and then, shooting up like
an uncoiled spring, he rocketed forward just as
Ramon fired. The ball grazed his cheek, but before
Ramon could pull the trigger a second time,
Pete had rushed in between his legs upsetting him
with a crash. So heavily did the Mexican chief
fall that he was stunned for the instant, but the
drowsy guard by the fire suddenly galvanized
into action, and sent a bullet flying after the cow-puncher
as he vanished in the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The uproar awakened the other captives, who
realized as soon as they saw that Coyote had
gone, what must have occurred. Their hearts
beat fast with apprehension for the brave plainsman,
as Ramon, coming out of his swoon, ordered
the now aroused camp to saddle at once and scatter
in pursuit of the refugee. The outlaw chief
himself took part in the search, leaving only three
men in the camp to guard the captives. As the
sound of the pursuing hoofs grew faint and far
the boys interchanged gloomy looks. If Coyote
had not seized a horse the chances were all
against his making good his escape, however he
had managed it.</p>

<p>“I fear we are worse off than ever, now,”
moaned the professor, shaking his head gloomily.</p>

<p>Coyote, meanwhile, who had familiarized himself
with the nature of the country as they rode
through it in the afternoon, made at once for the
tall scrub and brush at the lower end of the valley.
Through this he glided like a snake, and had
put half a mile between himself and the outlaws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>’
camp before he heard the clatter of horses’ hoofs.
He listened a minute and then shook his head
grimly.</p>

<p>“Bad!” he muttered, “they’re doing just what
I thought they would, spreading out in fan-shaped
formation. The only chance fer me ter
escape that human fine comb is to outflank ’em
and double back.”</p>

<p>Crouching low he darted along once more,
heading this time, however, in a direction sideways
from his former course. If he could reach
the end of that line of horsemen before they
encroached on his line of progress he might escape
them yet. He found himself hoping that
they were riding in open formation. If that were
the case,&mdash;although the starlight was pretty
bright,&mdash;he might be able to slip in between two
of the riders.</p>

<p>On and on he dashed and was just deeming
that success had come to him when he was
brought to an abrupt halt. Before him yawned
blackly a chasm of some sort, and Coyote had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
seen it only just in time to avoid plunging over
its brink into the unknown depths below. The
thought chilled him. He shuddered apprehensively.</p>

<p>“One more step and it would have been ‘goodnight,
Coyote,’ fer sure,” he soliloquized.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a loud shout behind him.
It was followed by a fusilade of bullets whistling
about his ears and pattering against the
rocks. In his shock at finding how near he had
been to a terrible death, Coyote had thoughtlessly
stood erect. Thus he offered a target that
could be seen for some distance against the stars.
That this had been the case, he could not doubt
as the shouts grew closer.</p>

<p>For one of the very few times in his life that
such had been the case, the old plainsman was at
a loss. In front was the chasm. Behind, the
Mexicans. But suddenly he saw something that
he thought might serve at a pinch.</p>

<p>It was a log, decayed and hollow, that lay near
the edge of the gulf into which he had so nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
fallen. The instant he perceived it, Pete dived
into it. Not that he did not feel some repugnance
to such a thing, for it was punky and rotten
and might, for all he knew, have sheltered
snakes. But there was nothing else for it.
Hardly had he crawled inside it, carefully drawing
in his legs, before Ramon and the advance
guard of the pursuers rode up.</p>

<p>Coyote Pete lay perfectly still. He hardly
dared to breathe, and heartily wished that he
could suspend his heart-action.</p>

<p>“Caramba! He was here an instant ago!” exclaimed
Ramon, glaring about, “where is the
accursed Gringo now?”</p>

<p>“Possibly struck by a bullet,” put in Canfield,
the red-headed man, who, having aided Pete to
escape, was now compelled to assume a bloodthirsty
role once more.</p>

<p>“Not likely. Perhaps he dropped over the
edge of the cliff and has escaped,” put in another
of the outlaw band who had just ridden up.</p>

<p>“But that would be suicide. The gully is deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and he would be dashed to pieces in its depths,”
struck in another.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” shouted Ramon suddenly, “I have
it!”</p>

<p>“What, you see him?” the query came from a
dozen throats.</p>

<p>“No, but I can guess where he is.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Here!” Ramon tapped the log with his foot,
while Coyote Pete fairly perspired in rivers.</p>

<p>“Let’s make sure,” cried the voice of Canfield.
He was about to dismount when Ramon checked
him.</p>

<p>“No. I have a better way.”</p>

<p>A kick on the log emphasized the Mexican’s
statement, and a sharp shock passed through Coyote
at the thought of the awful fate in store for
him. Had he had time at that moment he would
have emerged from the log and risked all. But
before he could move, a dozen hands laid hold
of the timber and began to roll it toward the
cliff edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop!” shouted Pete.</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Ramon, “then I was not mistaken.
Good! Go to your grave, you Yankee
pig, in the coffin you have made for yourself!”</p>

<p>Faster and faster the log rolled, while cries
of real fear and entreaty broke from Coyote’s
lips. In vain he tried to extricate himself.</p>

<p>All at once, the log gave a clumsy leap, and,
amid a brutal shout from the Mexicans, it spun
over the edge of the gulch and shot sheer over
into the black void that yawned below.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pch">WITH THE MEXICAN RANGERS.</p>

<p>Coyote Pete felt that he was passing through
the most critical moments of his adventurous life.
At the very least, he estimated the drop to the
bottom of the gully must be several hundred feet.</p>

<p>Obviously it was impossible for him to extricate
himself from the hurtling log, yet to remain
in it was to doom himself to almost certain
destruction. Yet, as the log shot down
like an object dropped from a balloon, he realized
that when it struck the earth he would be battered
into annihilation.</p>

<p>But even in a situation which would have
caused most men to swoon with terror, Coyote
could think, and think coolly, too.</p>

<p>Suddenly, though, there came a sudden interruption
to the downward progress of the great
log with its human freight enclosed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>Every nerve in Coyote Pete’s frame seemed to
be ripped asunder. Every tooth in his head was
jarred. He lay still, feeling pounded and
stunned, like a boy who has just had a hard fight
with some school tyrant.</p>

<p>“The log has landed, evidently,” he exclaimed,
“but how? Where? Why aren’t I dead?”</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware that the wood encasing
him like a coffin had become easier in its
pressure on him. He moved, and with a tearing,
rending sound the log burst asunder.</p>

<p>Like a butterfly from its cocoon,&mdash;if Coyote
will forgive me for comparing his rugged form
to a butterfly,&mdash;the cow-puncher, bruised,
wounded and sore in every limb, peered forth.
Where was he?</p>

<p>All at once he felt the portion of the log which
remained beneath him gently swaying like a boat
on rippling waves. In a short time, by cautious
feeling about him, he found that the log had,
by some providential miracle, landed on a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of island of trees growing, apparently, right
straight out from the cliff face. As he realized
his position the cold sweat burst out in great
drops on his brow and all over his body. If this
was the case his fate was to be worse than if he
had been dashed to pieces and mercifully killed
outright.</p>

<p>Hung where he was between heaven and earth,
he would have to die miserably of starvation, unless
madness intervened and he leaped crazily to
his own destruction. All at once, as he made
his investigations, his foot slipped, and with a
cry of actual terror the cow-puncher felt himself
beginning to dart downward through space. By
a desperate, despairing effort he clutched the
branches as he fell, and drew himself, with infinite
pains, back upon his precious perch. Once
there he lay trembling and nauseated at the
thought of the narrowness of his escape from a
plunge into the abyss.</p>

<p>Of all the tight places he had ever been in,
Coyote Pete was surely now in the very worst.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
He felt the wall behind him when he had somewhat
recovered from his attack of deadly sickness.
It was smooth as glass. No chance of
climbing up. He would have examined his surroundings
at greater length, but he dared not
risk another slip like the one that had so unnerved
him.</p>

<p>It was many years since Coyote Pete had
prayed, but he did so then, commending his soul
to his Maker, for that he would ever escape from
his frightful predicament he did not dare to hope.
Somewhat calmer after his devotions he lay still,
not daring to move lest the motion of his body
might dislodge some of the rotten wood, and he
could not bear to think of hearing it go dropping
down into that awful gorge beneath, finally losing
all sound in the dread profundities.</p>

<p>It was unlikely in the extreme that he would
ever be found, for in that unfrequented part of
the mountain fastnesses it was most improbable
that anyone ever passed. It was only the thirst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
for gold that had brought Ramon into the rugged
place.</p>

<p>There came no sound from above, and Coyote
concluded that the outlaws, hearing the crash
of the landing, had concluded that he was dead,
and departed.</p>

<p>“What a story fer the boys and the professor
to hyar,” groaned the unhappy man, burying his
face in his hands.</p>

<p>So the dark hours rolled away and daylight
came. But those hours of terror had unnerved
Coyote terribly. With the coming of day he
dreaded more than ever to look beneath him. He
felt that if he ever dared to gaze into the voids
which he felt must lie beneath his fragile perch,
that he must be impelled by a crazy desire to leap
into space.</p>

<p>So strong did this feeling become that he lay
there, not daring to look about him, until a sudden
sound smote on his ears,&mdash;the sharp rattle
of hoofs, coming apparently from the canyon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
above which his log was perched in such a precarious
condition.</p>

<p>The sound in arousing Coyote’s hopes of rescue,&mdash;though
how they were to rescue him he did
not know,&mdash;had likewise temporarily banished his
keener fears. Cautiously he peeped over the edge
of his eyrie and then gave vent to a shout of astonishment
that went echoing and roaring off
among the canyon walls.</p>

<p>“Mother of all the bob cats!” he howled, “here
I’ve bin lying all night ez scared ez a sick puppy
and not ten feet above the ground!”</p>

<p>Such, in fact, was the case. The trees in which
the log had so fortunately landed, grew out from
almost the base of the great cliff. Coyote, glancing
up, saw that they were the only ones on its
hundred and fifty feet of height.</p>

<p>“Coyote, you old idjut, ain’t you never goin’ to
larn?” the cowboy admonished himself. “Why
didn’t you drop suthin’ down ter see how far you
was above the ground, you consarned, double-barreled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
old chump? You’d hev saved yourself
some gray hairs ef you hed.”</p>

<p>Reproaching himself thus, the cow-puncher
dropped lightly from one of the lower branches
of the trees to the ground.</p>

<p>“Wish I’d done that when I slipped last night,”
he said. “Hold on, though, on second thoughts,
I don’t. I’d have bin dead o’ fright afore I
touched the ground in that case.”</p>

<p>But now the hoof beats which had attracted
his attention were coming nearer. The floor of
the canyon was so strewn with Titanic rock
masses, though, that it was impossible to see
more than a few yards in either direction.</p>

<p>“Wonder if that ain’t thet Ramon and his
bunch come ter look at ther remains?” thought
Pete. “Guess I’ll be on the safe side and jes’
duck a ’hind this yar rock till I make sure.”</p>

<p>So saying, he slipped between two boulders into
a small natural cave in which he felt he would be
secure from observation, and yet be able to see
what was going forward. He had not long to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
wait. Suddenly, around the corner of one of
the huge rock piles, there swung a troop of gaily
caparisoned riders; Mexicans, beyond a doubt.
Their serapes streamed out behind them in the
wind like gaudy streamers.</p>

<p>“Now, what bunch of pesky greasers is this
yar?” Pete was beginning to himself, when suddenly
he broke off in amazement:</p>

<p>“Jack Merrill’s among ’em, by ginger. He’s a
prisoner! No, he ain’t! He’s talking ter that
chap in front with ther silver-mounted rifle. Bob
cats! I have it now. It’s a troop of rurales, and
they’re on the trail of Ramon!</p>

<p>“Yip-yip-yee-ee-ee!”</p>

<p>Giving vent to the long-drawn cow-puncher
yell, Coyote Pete dashed from his place of concealment,
and a more astonished lad than Jack
Merrill I can assure you, you never saw, when he
perceived the old plainsman suddenly bob up out
of a great rock mass in that lonely canyon.</p>

<p>In his excess of joy Coyote fairly flung his
arms about Jack’s neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>But scant time could be given to greetings. Explanations
were in order. Exclamations of indignation
and of fury ran like wildfire among the
Rangers, as the old plainsman told his tale. Then
Jack related how he had fared, and how they had
trailed the marauders, being much delayed at
times, though, by faulty tracks where the party
had passed over hard ground.</p>

<p>“By ginger, I never noticed till now, that we
are in the same canyon we came through with
that outfit of Ramon’s late yesterday!” exclaimed
Pete. “Gloomy place, ain’t it? And it seemed
pretty glum to me last night, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>He gazed at the cliff and shuddered a little. He
could not help it.</p>

<p>“Say, Jack, hez my hair turned white?” he
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“No,” laughed the boy, “why?”</p>

<p>“Arter what I went through, I hearn tell of
such things. Me for a nice snug place in a stampede,
or the front rank in a shooting scrape arter
this. I’ve no more use for exciting sports.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“Senors,” interrupted the leader of the Rangers
presently, “we had better be proceeding.
Ramon may have broken camp and gone on by
this time, and again he may have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“May have what?” asked Jack, for the capitano
paused and seemed unwilling to proceed.</p>

<p>“I do not wish to alarm you unduly, senor,”
said the young officer, “but I know the character
of that notorious outlaw well. It is possible that
if we do not hurry we may arrive too late to
save your friends from a terrible fate.”</p>

<p>The thought was maddening to Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, that we have been fooling away time
here!” he exclaimed impatiently; “Pete, you can
mount behind me. There. Are you all right?
Yes? Then forward!”</p>

<p>“Forward!” shouted the officer, and the bugle
rang shrilly out.</p>

<p>Amidst a cloud of dust the Mexican Rangers
swept on down the canyon, intent on their errand
of vengeance.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CAPTAIN PLAYS A TRICK.</p>

<p>All at once, as they reached a part of the
canyon where it narrowed into a mere defile,
something came rattling down the side of the
steep wall to the right. It was a dislodged pebble,
but it caused the advancing corps to look
up swiftly.</p>

<p>Above them, outlined against the sky, were
several figures,&mdash;those undoubtedly of the men
of whom they were in search. As they were still
looking upward, the men on the cliff summit began
to pump down lead, the bullets singing and
droning and pattering about them like a leaden
hail storm.</p>

<p>“Hot work,” grunted Pete, noting with enthusiasm
the absolute collectedness of the leader of
the Rangers. He gave a sharp command and
his men swung into single file and pulled their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
ponies over till they were riding so close to the
rock wall of the canyon that it was necessary for
the riders to throw one leg up on the saddle. This
made it impossible for the marksmen on the summit
to pick them off, for the cliff hung outward
a little.</p>

<p>“As I thought, the rascals were prepared for
us,” said the young officer, “how far is it now,
Senor Coyote, to the camp?”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes should bring us thar,&mdash;ah!”</p>

<p>A big rock hurled from above struck the
ground in front of and a little to one side of the
advancing cavalcade. It split to pieces from the
force of its impact.</p>

<p>“If that had hit anyone his troubles would hev
bin over,” snorted Pete without turning a hair.</p>

<p>Jack paled a little, though. In a few seconds
they would reach a part of the canyon where
they could no longer crowd in under the slightly
overhanging cliff. At this point they would be
exposed to the full fury of any rifle fire or stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
volley which the brigands above might pour down
on them.</p>

<p>But the officer of the Rangers had, it seemed,
anticipated this. He ordered one of his men to
dismount and remove his regimentals. This
done, the empty garments were filled with brush
and leaves, and the sombrero was tied securely
to the upper part of the dummy, which, at a distance,
and particularly from above, would resemble
pretty closely a real man.</p>

<p>The dummy was then mounted on a pony, a
lame animal and not good for much. After its
“rider” had been securely fastened in place, the
pony was given a couple of whacks with the
Rangers’ long quirts, and frenzied with excitement
it plunged forward.</p>

<p>These operations had all been carried on in
the shadow of the overhanging cliff, and those
above had no knowledge of the trick that was
to be played on them till they saw the apparently
daring rider suddenly dash from the shelter. Instantly
a volley of rifle shots was poured down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
upon the dummy, and a veritable avalanche of
mighty rocks and boulders were hurled downward.
The luckless pony galloped bravely down
through this inferno of bullets and missiles, only
to have its life exterminated by a quick-killing
bullet after about five minutes of flight.</p>

<p>“Now, senors!”</p>

<p>The young officer, his eyes aflame, dashed forward,
followed by his Rangers and our adventurers.
The Ranger, whose pony had been sacrificed,
was carried on the back of another trooper’s
saddle. In a minute they were in the open
and a howl of fury from above testified how
thoroughly the outlaws had been tricked. Their
fire had been drawn and they had exhausted the
available supply of large rocks on the dummy!</p>

<p>As the column dashed across the unprotected
space, a scattering fire whistled about them, but
no more injury than a few punctured saddles
and a damaged hat or two was done. The next
instant the cavalcade swept out of the canyon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and into the small plateau where the camp of the
night before had been made.</p>

<p>A delighted shout burst from Jack’s lips, and
was echoed instantly by Coyote Pete as they perceived,
still tied and bound, their companions in
adventure. A feeble cry answered them, and an
instant later the reunited party was furiously
shaking hands, slapping backs and jumping about
in a thousand ecstatic antics, while the Rangers
looked on, shrugging their shoulders at the mad
Gringoes, and rolling cigarettes.</p>

<p>“Shall we pursue the outlaws?” asked Jack,
after the first transports were over and comparative
quiet had settled down.</p>

<p>The officer shook his head.</p>

<p>“It would be useless now. We have scattered
them and let us hope that we have heard the
last of them. It will be my duty, however, to keep
a constant lookout for them.”</p>

<p>To the boys’ delight, their stolen stock was all
there, too. Firewater whinnied delightedly as
he saw his young master, and even the burros<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
seemed to take part in the general rejoicing.
While the brigands had made some inroads on
the boys’ provisions, there still remained enough
food to last them, with care, on the remainder of
their dash for the Trembling Mountain.</p>

<p>After the tension of the last few hours it was
delightful to feel a sense of security once more.
Their enemies were scattered and it was unlikely
that the band would attempt any more high-handed
methods. Should they do so, however,
it would be too late, for before they set forward
on the last stage of their journey the adventurers
arranged with the captain to meet him and his
Rangers at a spot near the Trembling Mountain
in three days’ time.</p>

<p>The young officer willingly agreed, but expressed
some curiosity as to the nature of their
quest. He was informed that the object of the
expedition was a scientific one, to investigate the
reports of the relics of a forgotten race that lay
within the bowels of the mountain.</p>

<p>Jack parted with the Rangers with regret. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
had come to admire them for their dash, courage
and resource. They were ideal troops for the
rough country they patrolled and kept in order by
rough and ready methods. The young officer,
too, felt much regard for Senor Jack, as he called
him.</p>

<p>So a few hours after the reunion in the outlaws’
abandoned camp, the two parties set out
in different directions. The Rangers followed
the course they assumed that Ramon had taken
in his flight, while our adventurers struck out
for the smoking peaks which were now much
nearer than when they had had their first sight
of them. They traveled the rest of that day at
a good speed, and sunset found them camped in
a pleasant little valley where the broad-fronded
banana tree grew, whose fruit afforded a welcome
addition to their menu.</p>

<p>The next day, at noon, the professor, after
making an observation, announced that they were
then within a few hours’ travel of the Trembling
Mountain. This announcement was, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
hardly necessary, for all day a mighty peak, from
whose snow-covered summit there issued a lazy
roll of smoke, had overshadowed their way.
Everybody guessed that the frowning acclivity
was the mountain for which they had come so
far in quest.</p>

<p>Late afternoon brought them to its base, and
with his measuring instruments the professor,
an hour after camp had been pitched, located the
entrance which no other American, assuredly,
had ever passed. Their pulses beat swift and
hard, as the lads and Coyote followed the old man
over the rock-strewn slopes to the spot.</p>

<p>Amid a grove of dark, sombre trees,&mdash;somehow
suggesting a sacrificial grove,&mdash;lay the entrance
to the Trembling Mountain. All felt a
sense of mystical awe as they stood in the solemn
shadows. It was as if they had come under the
spell of some tremendous brooding presence.
Quite unconsciously they spoke in whispers.</p>

<p>It was the same feeling that overcomes one in
the aisle of some mighty cathedral. As if to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
accentuate the similarity of impression, the wind
sighing softly in the dark, dome-shaped trees,
sounded like a solemn chant, now high and tremulous,
now low in a rumbling diapason that
thrilled.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE DWELLING OF A VANISHED RACE.</p>

<p>“Gee, it’s kind of lonesome, ain’t it?” said Pete,
expressing exactly what they all felt.</p>

<p>Although they now stood in the presence of
the long-sought goal, somehow each one of the
party felt uncomfortably impressed. A nameless
fear hung about the place. It was with difficulty
that they shook off the feeling and examined
the surroundings further.</p>

<p>The entrance to the cave itself must have escaped
observation had one not known it was there.
It was square, with a mighty cross-bar of unhewn
stone supporting its summit. In this cross-bar
were cut some rude hieroglyphics, but even
the professor, savant though he was, could not
hazard a guess at their meaning.</p>

<p>The professor, alone, seemed unimpressed by
the gloomy majesty and mystery of the place. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
eyes burned with a scientific fire and he rubbed
his hands briskly together.</p>

<p>“At last!” he breathed, as if in an ecstasy,
“who knows what unknown treasures we may
reveal to the world, beyond that portal!”</p>

<p>“Shall we go inside?” asked Jack presently.</p>

<p>“We might as well now as at any other time,”
said the professor, “Ralph, will you and Walter
go back to the camp and get the torches?”</p>

<p>The lads at once hastened off on their errand.
Truth to tell, they were each rather glad to get,
for a short time only, out of the spell of that somber
spot.</p>

<p>The torches referred to were of the kerosene
variety, but specially made to burn for twenty-four
hours continuously. They had been made
to the professor’s order for the expedition.</p>

<p>The boys returned shortly with the illuminants.
Ralph also brought a supply of matches and a canteen
of water, and both boys had stuffed their
pockets full of what food they could hastily get
together. The professor praised their foresight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and then, from his own pocket, produced a huge
spool of coarse, strong thread.</p>

<p>“I took the hint from the classics,” he said,
“you all recollect the tale of the labyrinth? Well,
we will make this thread fast at the entrance, and
as we go along we will unwind it. In that way
if we get lost we can find our way back by feeling
along the thread.”</p>

<p>“That’s a splendid idea,” cried Jack, “I tell
you I shouldn’t much fancy the idea of going in
there, unless I was pretty sure how I was going
to get out again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you,” said the professor, “and
now are we all ready?”</p>

<p>“All right!” came in a chorus, and led by the
man of science, the adventurers crossed the mystic
threshold. A thrill shot through even Coyote
Pete, the least impressible of the party, as they
did so. How long had it been since the race
of ancient dwellers of the Chinipal had swarmed
those subterranean corridors, now as silent as
midnight?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The torches soon became necessary for the
passage sloped abruptly downward from the portal.
The smoky light showed them that they
were in a sort of corridor, seemingly hewn out
of the rock. It was about ten feet in width and
some eight or nine in height. The floor was worn
almost concave by the constant tread of the feet
that had passed and repassed in the bygone ages.</p>

<p>For some distance the sloping passage ran on,
and then they suddenly found themselves in a
vaulted chamber where their footsteps rang echoingly.
Great stalactites hung from the roof glittering
whitely as the torch light fell upon them.</p>

<p>“This is magnificent!” breathed the professor,
“a wonderland of science.” His voice, raised a
little in his enthusiasm, went booming and reverberating
hollowly through the place. From the
remotest corners there came rumbling back echo-like
the last words of his exclamation.</p>

<p>“I guess we had better not talk so loud,” said
Ralph, shivering a bit at this uncanny manifestation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, somebody might hear you,” scoffed Walt,
who was putting on an air of great assurance.
Suddenly he emitted a yell and jumped about four
feet. Something had crept up behind him in
the darkness and laid a cold hand on the back
of his neck. It was Coyote Pete who had noted
the boy’s arrogance and wanted to give him a
lesson. After that Walt was as quiet as a lamb.</p>

<p>Pressing forward, their torches showed them
the entrance to another dark passage on the other
side of the vaulted chamber.</p>

<p>“Shall we keep on?” asked the professor of
his young charges.</p>

<p>“By all means, so far as I am concerned,” was
Jack’s reply. “I don’t know about Walt, though,”
he added a trifle maliciously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right. Don’t worry about me,”
the ranch lad assured him.</p>

<p>“Then forward it is,” announced the professor,
plunging once more into the narrow confines
of a subterranean corridor.</p>

<p>But suddenly an alarming thing happened. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
great rush of wind beat against their faces accompanied
by a roaring, rushing sound, somewhat
like the voice of the cloudburst on the never-to-be-forgotten
night when they had lost their
equipment.</p>

<p>In a flash their torches were extinguished and
they were plunged into total darkness, something
soft and clammy brushed by Jack’s head
and then a perfect avalanche of the same unpleasant
things was upon them. They were
knocked down like ten pins by the charge, and
badly scared, too, as you may imagine.</p>

<p>Presently the noise and the turmoil ceased, and
the passage was quiet once more with the roar
of the mysterious creatures dying away in the
distance.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this!” cried Walt tremblingly.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said the professor. “We might
have expected some such thing. Those were bats.
Thousands of them, I guess, who have made their
home here undisturbed for centuries.”</p>

<p>“Wonder if they are of the kind that suck your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
blood?” shuddered Ralph, with the horror of the
contact of the clammy bodies still upon him.</p>

<p>“Vampires, you mean?” asked the professor.
“No, at least I don’t think so. We are too far
north for that. The vampire is found in South
America, in Brazil and so on. But let us light up
the torches again.”</p>

<p>Ralph produced the matches and a cheerful
red glow soon radiated upon the stone walls and
roof. A sickly, musty smell, the trace of the
bats, was still in the air, however, as a reminder
of their passing.</p>

<p>The passage soon ended, and the professor’s
feet encountered a steep flight of steps cut in
the stone, or so it seemed.</p>

<p>“Be careful, boys,” he warned, “a slip here
might prove fatal.”</p>

<p>Very cautiously, therefore, they descended into
what at first appeared to be a bottomless pit. Suddenly
their torches glittered on something that
shone like molten metal beneath them.</p>

<p>“Water!” cried the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“A lake,” added Jack, raising his torch so that
the light illumined what appeared to be a considerable
body of water.</p>

<p>“Water, sure enough,” echoed Pete, “maybe it’s
another subterranean river like that one at the
Haunted Mesa.”</p>

<p>“This is no river,” said the professor. “See,
its surface is as smooth as glass.”</p>

<p>By this time they had descended to the rocky
shelf which ran all around the edge of the subterranean
lake, while above their torch-light fell
redly on a domed roof of dark stone.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Walter suddenly, “Fish!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, they could now see shoals of
white-tinted fish swimming near the surface.</p>

<p>“Can it be that the light attracts them?” wondered
Jack.</p>

<p>“Not likely,” said the professor, “I guess they
are blind. It is not unusual to find fish in these
subterranean lakes. Specimens have been found
in our own country and in many places in Europe
which boast similar bodies of water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Walt had been leaning over the edge of the
lake intent, apparently, on trying to catch one
of the blind fish. Suddenly he gave a sharp outcry,
which was immediately followed by a splash.</p>

<p>“He is overboard!” cried Pete, rushing to the
spot and throwing himself on his stomach so as
to catch Walt when he rose to the surface. But
at that instant a startling thing happened.</p>

<p>Simultaneously almost with the splash of the
unlucky ranch boy, there came a sound as of
some great body rushing through the water from
some remote corner of the cave to which their
light did not penetrate. The next instant a cry
of real horror broke from all their throats as a
terrible misshapen head with blind eyes reared
itself above the water and darted at Walt as he
rose to the surface.</p>

<p>It was apparently a might eel, a creature of
undreamed of dimensions. Its slimy, whitish-colored
body was thick as a barrel and its lothsome
head and sightless slits of eyes gave it a
hideously repulsive appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pete! Pete! Save me!” shrieked Walt.</p>

<p>But in another instant it would have been too
late had it not been for the old plainsman’s coolness.
Stretching out one hand to Walt as he
struggled in the water, the cow-puncher’s other
hand slid to his waist. The next instant a shot
rang out sharply, and they saw the monster’s
head sink, a stream of red blood crimsoning the
water where their torches gleamed upon it.</p>

<p>Trembling in every limb at this narrow escape,
Walt was dragged out. The professor had had
the foresight to carry with him some stimulating
medicine, and a portion of this he poured down
the half-fainting lad’s throat. Under its influence
the naturally strong lad soon revived, but
there was still a scared look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“What could that monster have been?” asked
Jack with a shudder in his tones.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly a creature of the eel or giant
conger tribe,” rejoined the scientist, “I have read
that some of the ancient races used to keep such
creatures, and in some cases worshipped them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
even to the horror of nourishing them on human
lives.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” exclaimed Jack, “I’m glad that Coyote’s
shot killed the beast. But it could hardly have
been one of the original ones.”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said the professor, with a smile, “but
there is no reason why such creatures should not
multiply, and, as we know, there are plenty of
fish in the lake for them to feed upon.”</p>

<p>“Then there may be others in the water?”
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>“I see no reason why not. In fact, I&mdash;but,
good gracious, what is that?”</p>

<p>The water became suddenly violently agitated
as the body of the dead eel, fully forty feet in
length, arose lazily to the surface. The reason
was an onrush of its brethren gathering to a
cannibal feast. It was a fearsome sight to see
their jaws clamping and tearing, while their long
white tentacles waved.</p>

<p>“Let’s get away from here,” said the professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
presently. “See there is another passage. Let
us find out what that leads to.”</p>

<p>As he spoke there came a startling interruption.</p>

<p>A rumbling sound, somewhat as if a heavy
train were passing overhead, filled the cavern.
It shook violently and the waters of the lake
became wildly agitated. The monsters at once
left their feast and sank into the lake, leaving
the mangled body of their dead mate floating on
the surface.</p>

<p>The rumbling grew louder and the cavern
shook till the lake was lashed into little wavelets.</p>

<p>“It is the voice of the Trembling Mountain,”
said the professor solemnly; “somewhere the
mighty forces of nature’s forges are at work.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HEART OF THE MYSTERY.</p>

<p>“Sounds more to me as if Mrs. Nature had a
tummy ache,” said the unromantic Coyote Pete.</p>

<p>But nobody laughed at this remark. The
sounds were too awe-inspiring. Suddenly they
ceased as abruptly as they had begun, the rumblings
dying out like a sharp clap of thunder.</p>

<p>“Is there any danger?” inquired Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” rejoined the professor, “this
must have been going on for centuries, and, as
we know, the force of a volcano wanes instead of
waxing stronger as the centuries pass by.”</p>

<p>“Hope so, I’m sure,” put in Walt, “I can tell
you, I’ve had quite enough excitement for one
day.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that is the case with all of us,”
was the rejoinder, “but amid all these natural
wonders and alarms we must not forget that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
came here on a definite mission,&mdash;namely to carry
back with us what we can of the reputed treasure.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Coyote, “and so far as
I’m concerned, I’m for pushing on.”</p>

<p>That seemed to be in accordance with the
wishes of the entire little company, so, forward it
was.</p>

<p>They plunged into the passage that the professor
had indicated and traversed it for some
distance before they struck anything out of the
ordinary.</p>

<p>It was perhaps half an hour before they began
to notice that the tunnel was beginning to be irradiated
by a light far stronger than that thrown
by their torches, a bright piercing glare that
seemed to burn like white fire. It grew very
much warmer, too, and the perspiration streamed
down all their faces.</p>

<p>“We are approaching the subterranean fires,”
said the professor, “in all probability some titanic
flame of natural gas. By the roaring sound I
hear, I believe that to be a correct statement of
the facts.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-256.jpg" width="400" height="593"

     <p class="pc400">In the midst of a rock chamber, there arose a great flame of an
almost white hue.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sounds like a blast furnace in full swing,”
said Ralph.</p>

<p>Suddenly the passage widened and a dazzling
scene broke upon their gaze. In the midst of a
rock chamber even larger, as well as they could
judge, than the cave of the lake, there arose a
great flame of an almost white hue. It was blue
at the base like an ordinary gas flame and roared
straight up with terrific force as if fed by great
reservoirs of natural gas.</p>

<p>“In all probability it was ignited at the time
that the volcano was active and has burned ever
since,” opined the professor. “Young men, if
we found nothing else within this cavern we have
already experienced more than falls to the lot
of even exceptional men in their lifetime. Such
sights as these we shall never forget.”</p>

<p>“It’s a Flower of Flame!” exclaimed Jack
poetically.</p>

<p>“If you could corner that light and sell it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
there’d be a pile of money in it,” said the practical
Ralph.</p>

<p>“Well, as time is precious, let us be pressing
on,” said the professor, “for, speaking of money,
we must recollect that we have, as yet, found no
trace of the treasure.”</p>

<p>After converging upon the chamber of the
Flower of Flame, the passage once more plunged
into the innermost regions of the mountain. For
a space it twisted and turned, and then, without
the slightest warning, the adventurers experienced
a sharp shock. They faced a blank wall.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s the finish,” announced Walt,
holding up his torch.</p>

<p>“Looks like it,” agreed Jack, “yet it seems odd
that those old tribes would have gone to all the
trouble to drill that passage if it ends right
here.”</p>

<p>“Just what I think, my boy,” said the professor,
“and by the same token, look here!”</p>

<p>He indicated a big ring of some yellowish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
metal that hung directly in the center of the
seeming blank wall.</p>

<p>“I’ll experiment,” he said, giving it a twist.</p>

<p>But nothing occurred.</p>

<p>Then he tried tugging it. Again no result
followed.</p>

<p>“Look,” cried Ralph suddenly, “there’s a metal
plate under your feet, professor. Perhaps if you
stand on that and then tug you will have some
results.”</p>

<p>“That sounds reasonable,” said Professor Wintergreen,
doing as the boy had indicated.</p>

<p>This time, amid a cheer from the boys, something
did happen. The door slowly swung on invisible
hinges and beyond it their torch-lights
fell on a scene of almost overwhelming grandeur.</p>

<p>It was a chamber, seemingly of gleaming white
marble. Around the walls, at regular intervals,
were ranged the figures of what appeared to be
idols, but which they presently discovered were
perfectly embalmed bodies of past rulers of the
mountain dwellers. At one end of the chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
on a raised dais was a hideous figure which they
readily guessed to be the deity of the forgotten
race.</p>

<p>The face of this image was spread into a monstrous
expression of malignant cruelty. But it
was the eyes that startled them. They blazed in
the torch-lights like two balls of fire.</p>

<p>“They are rubies!” cried the professor, rushing
forward. As he did so, his eye fell upon
a heap of golden ornaments and jeweled vessels
at the foot of the huge statue. Evidently they
had been left there as offerings on the day of
the mysterious occurrence that had wiped out
the tribe.</p>

<p>But as the man of science made his dart toward
the pile, a strange thing happened. The
gaping mouth of the statue opened wide, and
from it there poured a puff of gas so baleful in
odor that the boys reeled back. But the professor,
upon whom the full force of the blast had
concentrated itself, gave a few staggering footsteps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and then plunged to the marble floor in a
senseless condition.</p>

<p>“So that is the way those old fellows protected
their treasure,” snorted Pete. “Wall, it was a
good one, too, and no mistake. Come on, boys,
and drag the professor out of that.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there danger of our being poisoned by
that gas, too?” asked Walt, still shaken by his
previous experience in danger.</p>

<p>“Even if there was, it ’ud be our duty ter get
the professor out of that,” said Pete severely,
“but I noticed that the professor stepped on a
particular stone as he reached for them treasures.
I guess it is only that stone, behind which the stuff
is piled, that works the gas consarn.”</p>

<p>And so it proved. By carefully avoiding the
stone which was of a dark blood-color, they
dragged the professor to a place of safety, and
with water from the canteen and some of his
own stimulant, they soon had him on his feet
again.</p>

<p>“I should have been upon the lookout,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
“I ought to have known that the priests of the
tribe would have taken some precautions to protect
the offerings from marauders.”</p>

<p>“But the gas only works when you step on that
particular stone,” objected Jack.</p>

<p>“I suppose with the ignorant folk with whom
they had to deal, one lesson of that sort was
quite sufficient. That is the logical stone to step
upon, and having once tested it, nobody was likely
to try again,” rejoined the professor.</p>

<p>“And now to gather up the treasure, or what
we can of it,” said Jack.</p>

<p>Pete produced a big roll of sacking which, on
being distributed, proved to consist of burlap
bags, one for each member of the party.</p>

<p class="pp7q p1">“Here we are, on Tom Tiddler’s ground,<br />
Picking up gold and silver!”</p>

<p class="p1">So sang the boys, as sacks in hand they rushed
forward.</p>

<p>“This girdle for me!” cried Jack, holding up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
a belt of golden coins with great, rough rubies
encrusting it.</p>

<p>“This goblet takes my eye,” quoth Ralph, stowing
a golden vessel, likewise jewel-encrusted,
into his receptacle.</p>

<p>Besides the wrought gold there were ingots of
gold in the rough, silver articles of all sorts, and
all gem-studded. The heap blazed and flashed
with a hundred fires as the torches gleamed upon
it. They all worked like beavers and before long
the sacks were full with a burden that was quite
heavy enough for any of the party to wish to
carry.</p>

<p>“Well, this will be all for this trip,” decided the
professor when their task was completed, “and
now for the open air.”</p>

<p>With the scientist leading the way, his long
legs fairly sagging under his burden, they began
to retrace their footsteps, fingering the thread as
they went.</p>

<p>“What should you estimate the value of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
haul at?” Ralph asked, as they once more passed
the portal.</p>

<p>“At a rough guess at least $500,000, apart
from the value of the collection as antiquities,”
said the professor. “It is without doubt the most
valuable archeological collection ever stumbled
upon.”</p>

<p>Past the Flower of Flame and past the lake of
the blind, monstrous eels they retraced their steps,
their hearts beating triumphantly at the magnificent
conclusion of their long and adventurous
quest.</p>

<p>But as they reached the Cave of the Stalactites
the subterranean chambers were filled with a
sudden terrifying sound. It seemed to drive
the ear drums in with its fierce impact. The adventurers
felt themselves lifted from their feet
and then violently hurled to the ground again. A
rush of nauseous smelling gas enveloped them,
splitting their heads with its pungent fumes.</p>

<p>The earth shook and trembled and a reverberating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
roar as of the explosion of a powder magazine
filled the whole atmosphere.</p>

<p>Some terrific catastrophe had occurred within
the confines of the caves in the heart of the Trembling
Mountain. Following the explosion there
came a sound like that of a landslide.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE DEATH TRAP.</p>

<p>“What can have happened?”</p>

<p>It was Jack who spoke some ten minutes later.</p>

<p>“In my opinion some cataclysm has occurred,”
said the professor.</p>

<p>“Meaning by that, that there’s bin a most almighty
bust-up?” inquired Pete.</p>

<p>“In colloquial language that was the idea I
intended to convey,” said the professor, with
dignity.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think this catty&mdash;what-you-may-call-’em
has done?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Sealed forever the treasure caves,” said the
professor promptly. “That explosion we heard
was either the ignition of gas from the mouth
of the idol or it marked the birth of a new Flower
of Flame. In any event the roar and tremble
which followed was pretty good evidence that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
there had been subsidence of the rock in that
neighborhood, which, of course, means that the
passageways must have caved in.</p>

<p>“Well, we got our share out of it,” said Ralph
philosophically.</p>

<p>“Yet it is a great pity that such a thing has occurred,”
said the professor sorrowfully, “I had
been in hopes of making this cave the Mecca of
scientists the world over. This explosion has
blasted my dreams of such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Wall, don’t feel too bad about it, professor,”
comforted Pete, “we got enough stuff to start a
show of our own with, anyhow.”</p>

<p>As there was nothing to be gained by remaining
in the cave, they decided to get out to the
open air as soon as possible. As they went Jack
spoke up suddenly:</p>

<p>“Has it occurred to you fellows that we are
carrying a bait that might tempt less dangerous
fellows than that band of Ramon’s to plunder
us?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Pete, “but I guess we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
won’t be bothered. Nobody but Ramon had wind
of our mission, and I don’t imagine that after the
lesson the Rangers gave him that he’ll come back
in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that,” said Jack, “from
what I know of him he’s not the sort of man to
let go of a good thing if he can help it, and he’d
certainly have a good thing in us, providing he
could get the treasure away from us.”</p>

<p>“Always provided,” said Ralph, “but I’ll bet
we’d give him a sharp tussle for it.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope nothing of the kind occurs,” said
the professor, “we have had difficulties enough
on our mission, and now that it is over let us hope
we can bring it to a peaceful conclusion.”</p>

<p>“Amen to that,” agreed Pete, “but in time of
peace prepare for war, you know. Have you
any plans for the return home?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the man of science, “the city of
Hermosillo on the Mexican West Coast Railroad
is not many miles from where we now are. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
idea is to make for that and take the train back
home.”</p>

<p>“Hooray for the good old U. S. A.!” shouted
the Border Boys in chorus.</p>

<p>Conversing cheerily in this manner they
reached the mouth of the passage and were about
to step out into the starlight, when Pete, who
was in advance, held up his hand in a signal that
they all had no difficulty in interpreting.</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>The keen eyes of the cow-puncher had detected
several dark forms skulking in the shadows of
the grove about the portal of the cave. From
their manner of pacing about, Pete immediately
guessed that they were sentries posted there by
somebody, whom he concluded could be no other
than Ramon.</p>

<p>Retreating down the passage, Pete told the others
of his suspicions and a council of war at once
followed.</p>

<p>“We’re hemmed in beyond a doubt,” said Jack
finally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the question is, how to get out,” put in
the professor, as solemnly as if some question had
been raised about the matter.</p>

<p>“Wall, if we don’t git out afore long, we’re
gone coons,” was Pete’s gloomy contribution.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack spoke up.</p>

<p>“Do you think the sentries saw or heard us,
Pete?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. If they had, we’d uv heard of it
by now. My idea of the situation is this: Ramon
outwitted the Rangers and back tracked on us.
Arriving at our camp and finding it deserted, he
guessed we’d gone arter the treasure. The rascal
thinks to himself that we will make fine cat’s-paws
to draw his chestnuts out of the fire, and so,
knowing he has us bottled up, he sets those sentries
on duty arter he’s tracked us up the mountain side.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s about it,” rejoined the boy; “the
question is, what are we to do?”</p>

<p>“Wait till I go and look the land over a bit,”
said Coyote. “In the meantime, put out those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
torches. If one of those greasers should come
snooping into the passage, he might see the glow
and nose us out.”</p>

<p>So they waited in total darkness while Coyote
departed on his scouting errand. It was a long
time before he came back. When he did he was
chuckling to himself.</p>

<p>“They’re the worst scared bunch you ever
saw,” he said, “I laid behind a rock and listened
to ther talk. They think that at any moment some
spirits or ghosts is likely to pop out of this hole.
They likewise opine that we shall never be seen
again because the bogies in the mountain have
gobbled us up.”</p>

<p>“But what good does that do us?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” admitted Pete, “except that it
sounded funny to hyar a bunch of grown men so
scared of spooks.”</p>

<p>“Light up a torch, Ralph,” said Jack the next
minute, “it makes me feel creepy to sit here in
the dark.”</p>

<p>Ralph reached into his pocket for the bundle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
sulphur matches. As he drew his hand out, his
fingers, moistened with perspiration, gleamed
greenly with the phosphorus which had adhered
to them.</p>

<p>“Gee, look at that stuff blaze!” he exclaimed,
“you’d think I was on fire!”</p>

<p>But Jack was on his feet doing a sudden ecstatic
war dance.</p>

<p>“Hooray! Hooray! I’ve got it!” he cried.</p>

<p>“The extinguisher?” inquired Walt anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, a plan. A great plan! Those greasers
outside are all half frightened out of their lives
already. We’ll finish the job!”</p>

<p>“How?” the question came in chorus.</p>

<p>“We’ll smear our faces with that phosphorus
from the matches, and then rush out looking like
a lot of green ghosts. If that won’t stampede
them, we’ll have to fight. We can’t stay mewed
up in here.”</p>

<p>“By hookey, boy, you’ve got it all right!” cried
Pete in a voice vibrant with excitement. “We’ll
try it. As you say, we can’t stop hyar and starve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and that’s what it amounts to if we don’t git
out.”</p>

<p>“So it’s scare them or fight them,” said Ralph.</p>

<p>“That is, with the odds in favor of the former,”
laughed Jack.</p>

<p>Each of the party wet his face with water
from the canteen, and then rubbed the matches
over his features till they glared greenly in the
darkness with a truly terrifying expression. Then
they gave their hands similar treatment.</p>

<p>“Gee, I’ll bet I’d be scared of myself if I could
see myself,” laughed Ralph, “you fellows look
hideous enough to frighten a pack of brass monkeys.”</p>

<p>“Now to see if it will work on those other
monkeys outside,” said Jack.</p>

<p>In single file, Pete first, Jack second, and the
others coming behind, they softly approached the
end of the passage. In the starlight they could
see the dark forms of the sentries huddled pretty
close together, for companionship doubtless.</p>

<p>“Now!” whispered Pete suddenly, “and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
more hoorendously you yell, the better it will
be!”</p>

<p>With a series of the most unearthly screeches,
the Border Boys and their companions dashed
from the cave mouth. Truly they must have
been a terrifying spectacle with their glaring
green faces and hands, emerging as they did
from a cave which the superstitious Mexicans
firmly believed to be haunted.</p>

<p>As the first shrill cries rang out, the sentries
gave an answering series of yells. Only their
cries, instead of being menacing and uncanny like
our adventurers’, were shrill screams of terror.</p>

<p>“Caramba! The ghosts of the caves!” they
shrieked.</p>

<p>“Santa Maria! They are after us!”</p>

<p>“Run for your lives, hombres!”</p>

<p>Without stopping to collect their rifles, which
they had carelessly piled against the trees, the
Mexicans dashed off at top speed, stumbling and
then struggling to their feet again and dashing
on in their wild panic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>The adventurers at once possessed themselves
of the rifles and then came to a halt. But Pete
addressed them:</p>

<p>“We must foller up our advantage. We have
’em on the run. Foller ’em while we’ve got ’em
going!” he cried.</p>

<p>Once more off dashed the green ghosts, hotly
pursuing the fleeing Mexicans, whose yells resounded
everywhere. In the camp was Ramon
himself. He was suddenly aroused as his terrified
band came stumbling in, imploring aid from
all the saints in the calendar.</p>

<p>“What is this, you dogs!” he bawled, “what
does this mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the ghosts! The ghosts with the green
faces that burn, and the fiery hands!” screamed
the panic-stricken Mexicans.</p>

<p>The shrewd outlaw at once guessed what had
occurred. But even his iron nerve was shaken
as he saw the green-faced spectres sweeping
down the mountain side toward him. He stood
his ground, however, and by his side stood Canfield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the red-headed American. But the two,
unsupported by the band, were no match for the
well-armed Border Boys and their companions,
and they knew it.</p>

<p>“Surrender or be shot down like a dog!” cried
Coyote Pete in Spanish, as they rushed into the
camp. In the distance could be heard the yells
of the scared Mexicans as they leaped to their
horses and dashed off, deserting their leaders.</p>

<p>Ramon’s reply was to fire point blank at the
cow-puncher. The bullet grazed his cheek and
caused a temporary halt. In that brief instant
Ramon and Canfield turned and dashed away at
top speed. They scrambled upon their horses
bareback, and in a jiffy the thunder of hoofs told
that they, too, were off.</p>

<p>The adventurers instantly saddled their own
stock and set off in pursuit. They had no intention
of losing such an advantage as they now
possessed. But their animals were no match for
the fleet black, and daylight found them far to
the rear of the chase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>But in the meantime Destiny, which had overtaken
Ramon at last, had arranged a fitting finale
for his tempestuous career. The Rangers, true
to their promise, were on their way to meet our
party at the place agreed upon, and at daybreak
Ramon and Canfield, white faced, dust covered
and desperate, encountered the rough and ready
cavalry in a narrow defile. Ramon at once
swung his black and dashed off like the wind,
leaving Canfield on his exhausted beast to fall
an easy prey to the Rangers. Leaving a file of
men to guard the prisoner, the captain of the
Rangers dashed off in hot pursuit of Ramon and
his fleet steed. But the great horse easily outdistanced
his followers, and had it not been for
the hands of Destiny, Ramon might once more
have escaped his end.</p>

<p>But as he shot out of the defile he spied, coming
toward him, the Border Boys. The rascal
was fairly trapped. Behind him were the Rangers,
in front the Border Boys. As he hesitated,
Coyote Pete cried in a loud voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you surrender?”</p>

<p>The Mexican’s reply was to dash back once
more. Perhaps he hoped to ride and trample his
way through the Rangers. But what desperate
thoughts raced through his mind in those last
moments we shall never know, for presently, as
the Rangers approached, a volley came whizzing
about the cornered desperado.</p>

<p>One chance of escape only, had he. On the
opposite side of the defile lay a narrow ledge
running to the top of the sheer cliff. Could he
gain that he might stand a chance of escape. Before
they realized what he was about to do,
Ramon saw the desperate loophole and gathered
his horse for the impossible leap across the chasm.</p>

<p>The gallant black, true as steel to his unworthy
master to the last, never faltered. Straight out
into the air he shot, while the Border Boys and
the Rangers alike sat spellbound by the scene.</p>

<p>The horse’s forefeet touched the opposite
ledge, but the hold was too weak. With a shrill
whinny of terror, with which mingled a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
scream from Ramon, the beautiful and gallant
animal went crashing backward, down, down into
the depths of the abyss,&mdash;while the horror-stricken
onlookers sat paralyzed in their saddles!</p>

<table id="tb" summary="tb">

</table>

<p>The next day a happy party set out from the
region of the mystic caves, carrying a freight
of treasure and escorted by the Mexican Rangers,
who, by Don Alverado’s wish, were to offer
them all the protection possible.</p>

<p>An examination of the caves had shown that
the professor’s guess that they had been sealed
for all time by the explosion of the natural gases
was correct. Beyond the first great chamber the
foot of man would never more penetrate.</p>

<p>At evening on the second day of their
journey, the roofs of Hermosillo came in sight.
And then the captain of the Rangers turned to our
party.</p>

<p>“Our duty is done, senors,” he said, saluting,
“yonder is the end of your journey.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” said Jack, reddening a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and lowering his voice, “here are two letters I
will ask you to deliver when you reach Santa
Anita once more. And a packet,” he added, handing
the officer the articles.</p>

<p>“I shall see that they reach their destination
safely,” said the officer, taking them and thrusting
them into the bosom of his coat. “And now,
adios!”</p>

<p>“Adios!” The cry was caught up by the Rangers
and went echoing out along the mountain
side.</p>

<p>At the same instant, as though moved by a
common impulse, the Mexicans swung their wiry
ponies and dashed off toward the East. The
Border Boys stood watching them till in a cloud
of dust they vanished from their sight forever.
Then turning in silence they rode down into
Hermosillo. Here telegrams were despatched
telling of the success of their quest, and the
next day they boarded the train for home. The
ponies traveled less luxuriously than their masters,
in a stock car, while in the express coach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
guarded by shotgun messengers, were the precious
trophies of the cave.</p>

<p>“Say, Jack, if I’m not too curious, what was
in that package that you handed the officer yesterday?”</p>

<p>The question came from Ralph.</p>

<p>“A present of gems for himself and his men,”
was the rejoinder. “I knew you would think I
did right in giving it to them. In fact, I had
the professor’s permission to do so.”</p>

<p>“And the letters?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack, “one was to Don Alverado
thanking him for all he had done, and bidding
him good-bye. The other was to&mdash;somebody
else.”</p>

<p>For a time the boy sat silent, gazing from the
windows at the flying landscape,&mdash;and seeing
nothing of its details!</p>

<p>But the past was behind them, and Jack was
not the boy to waste time on moonshiny thoughts.
In fact, while all the party lingered long in memory
among the strangely varied scenes of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
recent experiences, life was full of a new zest,
and the future beckoned them.</p>

<p>Ere long, to share with you our prophetic
knowledge, the keenest faculties of the Border
Boys were to be called into action. In Texas,
the Lone Star State, some work, play and adventure
lay in front of them, and those who have
hitherto followed our Border Boys through their
careers of incident and excitement, may find more
about them in another volume, which will be
called “The Border Boys With The Texas
Rangers.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
